# OCHA Charts

This is the repository for the charts and data visualisations at the OCHA sites. All charts and data visualisations made with [D3.js](https://d3js.org), a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data.

Instructions for the use of the data visualisations in their links.


## CSS

All charts and data visualisations use a [common CSS](https://github.com/CBPFGMS/cbpfgms.github.io/raw/master/css/) file.

## List of charts

Each chart and data visualisation is identified by a unique six-letter code. This unique code is present in the JavaScript file name and in all HTML classes and IDs used by the respective code.
