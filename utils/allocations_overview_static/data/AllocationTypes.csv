2024 2nd Reserve Allocation,"The strategic focus of this allocation aims to ensure that life-saving assistance reaches most vulnerable populations, particularly in geographic areas where humanitarian assistance is limited.  Given the onset of winter, the vulnerabilities faced by affected communities will be significantly exacerbated. To address the immediate and critical needs of these populations, this allocation is released through the reserve modality. The design of this allocation is based on the Humanitarian Coordinator’s Vision Paper for the AHF (2024) with a specific focus given to area-based approaches and multi-sector humanitarian programming.  It prioritizes community consultations and supports local community priorities through comprehensive interventions and a coordinated, localized response—key elements in ensuring the effective use of AHF funding.

2025 2nd Reserve Allocation: pilot consortium approach,"The Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund (AHF) is piloting a consortium-based approach to enhance partnerships with local humanitarian actors, including women-led organizations (WLOs)  and civil society organizations (CSOs). This initiative aims to:  •	Strengthen collaboration with local humanitarian actors by fostering partnerships between AHF-funded humanitarian organizations and small CSOs.  •	Provide lifesaving saving assistance to the most vulnerable population  •	Expand AHF’s pool of partners by engaging non-AHF organizations, particularly WLOs and CSOs, to improve the reach and quality of humanitarian assistance “by women, for women”.  •	Drive transformative change in localization efforts by supporting inclusive and sustainable partnerships that reinforce the role of local responders in crisis response.    As part of this $2.4 million pilot allocation, equal funding will be made available for three consortia of national NGOs (NNGOs), international NGOs (INGOs), and UN agencies, funds, and programs. Consortium members include WLOs and organizations of persons with disabilities (OPDs) and ensure a diverse and community-driven humanitarian response.     This pilot will contribute to a more localized and effective humanitarian response, strengthening the resilience of affected communities through meaningful engagement with local actors. It will prioritize: i) communities affected by climate change, supporting their resilience and mitigating the humanitarian impact of natural disasters through emergency agriculture and disaster-risk reduction activities, ii) protection and strengthening safeguarding mechanisms, ensuring safety and dignity of affected populations, particularly women, girls and persons with disabilities through case management and cash and emergency vocational training for women at risk, and iii) women’s empowerment and inclusion in humanitarian decision-making and service delivery through small grants provision.

2025 3rd Reserve Allocation: Anticipatory Action: Drought,"Vulnerable communities across Afghanistan, one of the world's most climate-vulnerable countries, experience high risks of drought with depleting groundwater levels and precipitation deficits. Humanitarian needs include food and livelihoods assistance, safe water and sanitation, health, nutrition, and protection services in the areas most at-risk of Spring season drought. Against this backdrop, the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund (AHF) launches a $10 million allocation to support innovative approaches for anticipatory action (AA) for drought. It builds on growing evidence that acting prior to the onset of a predictable hazard is significantly more (cost-)effective than traditional humanitarian response. In joint allocation with CERF ($10 million), both pooled funds support priorities listed in a coordinated AA framework developed by OCHA in collaboration with UN Agencies under the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator’s leadership (Annex 1).

2024 Second Reserve Allocation,"La recrudescence des violences basées sur le genre (VBG) en République Centrafricaine, notamment dans les préfectures d’Ouham-Pendé et Lim-Pendé, souligne des besoins pressants, en particulier dans les communes éloignées des centres des sous-préfectures. Malgré des interventions en cours, l’accès aux services de protection contre les VBG, notamment l’assistance médicale, reste limité en raison du manque d’acteurs qualifiés :  entre 80-90% des aires de santé dans ces deux sous-préfectures ne sont pas desservies. Cela empêche une prise en charge adéquate et dans les délais des survivant(e)s de VBG, en dessous des normes minimales de l'IASC. Face au nombre de cas de violence déclarés, il est impératif de restaurer immédiatement les délais de 72h pour ne pas minorer les efforts de sensibilisation sur les services de référencement et ni décourager les survivantes à s’engager dans les activités de protection.   Cette allocation de réserve de 500 000 USD permettra d’étendre la couverture des services VBG, en particulier dans les zones sous-desservies. En intégrant un soutien holistique, y compris médical, elle répondra aux besoins des populations réfugiées du Tchad et déplacées internes et communautés hôtes, exposées à des risques accrus de VBG.   Avec cette allocation, les partenaires du FH RCA visent à assister 16 642 personnes, dont 10 284 femmes, 2 818 hommes, 705 garçons et 2 835 filles, dans les zones prioritaires, assurant ainsi une réponse coordonnée et conforme aux normes humanitaires.

2025 Fifth Réserve Allocation,"Face à une détérioration soudaine de la situation sécuritaire et humanitaire dans la préfecture de la Vakaga, en particulier dans la zone frontalière avec le Soudan, le Coordonnateur Humanitaire lance une allocation de réserve (RA5) d’un montant de 3 mil-lions USD afin de permettre une réponse rapide, ciblée et intégrée aux besoins humanitaires les plus critiques.    Cette allocation est déclenchée par l’escalade des violences armées observée en septembre 2025  autour d’Am-Dafock, ayant entraîné des pertes civiles, la destruction de biens et le déplacement d’environ 5 000 personnes vers des zones déjà fragiles et faiblement couvertes par l’aide humanitaire. Dans un contexte de sous-financement chronique du HNRP et de contraintes d’accès accrues liées à l’insécurité et à l’isolement géographique de la Vakaga, cette allocation vise à prévenir une détériora-tion rapide des conditions de vie des populations affectées et à réduire les risques de protection, en particulier pour les femmes et les enfants.    À l’issue de consultations avec les clusters, les partenaires humanitaires et le Comité Consultatif du FH RCA, l’allocation sou-tiendra une réponse multisectorielle et contextualisée dans les secteurs de l’Eau, Hygiène et Assainissement (EHA), de la Santé, de la Protection et de la prévention et réponse aux Violences Basées sur le Genre (VBG).

2025 First Reserve Allocation,"Face aux chocs humanitaires récents (notamment les violences armées, l’insécurité alimentaire aigue, violences basées sur    genres…) survenus dans la sous-préfecture Ouadda qui ont exacerbé la vulnérabilité des populations locales, et en complément    des besoins persistants généralement dans la préfecture de la Haute-Kotto, le Coordonnateur Humanitaire pour la République    Centrafricaine lance une allocation de réserve initiale de 600 000 dollars américains (USD). L’allocation mettra un accent    particulier sur les solutions durables et la cohérence entre aide humanitaire et les interventions de développement en cours    dans la zone, tout en intégrant et renforçant les dimensions transversales telles que la protection, le genre, l’inclusion, et la    redevabilité. Les ONG locales et nationales bénéficiant de cette allocation seront considérées comme de véritables partenaires    décisionnels, pleinement impliqués dans la conception et l’orientation stratégique des projets.      Cette allocation marque une étape importante dans la mise en œuvre de la vision 2025 du Coordinateur humanitaire pour un    financement plus inclusif, localisé et centré sur les personnes affectées. Pour la première fois, ce sont les communautés elles-    mêmes qui seront au cœur des décisions stratégiques du FH RCA : elles identifieront les priorités et les activités à financer. Ce    changement d’approche vise à renforcer la redevabilité envers les populations affectées et à ancrer les projets dans leurs besoins    réels en s’appuyant sur les orientations nationales autour de l’opérationnalisation du Nexus, de l’inclusivité et de la localisation.    De plus, l’allocation devrait contribuer à améliorer l’accès des partenaires dans cette zone. L’allocation entend démontrer que    la participation communautaire dès la phase de planification stratégique est à la fois possible et essentielle pour une aide plus    pertinente, durable et efficace en RCA. Ce modèle, fondé sur le dialogue continu, la transparence et l’influence réelle des    communautés sur les ressources, ambitionne d’inspirer d’autres mécanismes de financement humanitaire.",Reserve,1100000,6/30/2025 12:00:00 AM,7/25/2025 12:00:00 AM,FH RCA_RA1 2024_Annexe 3_Lignes directrices AAP_Version Finale_26 juin 2024.pdf##1295902##Allocation Type##https://onegms.unocha.org/pubdocs/Allocationsdocs/CAR-AllocDocs_2025_1460_1396.pdf##|||FH RCA_SA1 2024_Modalités opérationnelles_Version Finale_23 Juin 2025.pdf##137868##Allocation Type##https://onegms.unocha.org/pubdocs/Allocationsdocs/CAR-AllocDocs_2025_1460_1397.pdf##|||FH_RCA_RA1_2025_ STRATEGY_VF.pdf##452923##Allocation Type##https://onegms.unocha.org/pubdocs/Allocationsdocs/CAR-AllocDocs_2025_1460_1398.pdf##,17,CAR,2025,République Centrafricaine Besoins Humanitaires et ##2025,7/25/2025 12:00:00 AM,0,0,3,1100000,1460,1,1
2025 Fourth Reserve Allocation,"La situation humanitaire dans le sud-est de la République centrafricaine, notamment dans les préfectures de la Basse Kotto, du Mbomou et du Haut Mbomou, demeure critique. Plus de XXX personnes y font face à des besoins urgents dans un contexte de violences persistantes, de déplacements massifs et d’accès limité aux services essentiels.    Pour renforcer la continuité de la réponse et combler les lacunes restantes tout en maintenant des capacités opérationnelles critique dans les zones identifiées, le Coordonnateur Humanitaire, avec l’appui du Comité Consultatif du FH RCA, lance une allocation de $5 millions. Celle-ci viendra compléter le financement CERF UFE 2025 en étendant la couverture humanitaire à des zones voisines et en facilitant l’accès opérationnel des partenaires.     Deuxième allocation de l’année fondée sur les priorités exprimées par les communautés , cette initiative poursuit l’objectif de renforcer la redevabilité et d’ancrer la réponse dans les besoins réels des populations. De plus, en cohérence avec les orienta-tions nationales sur le Nexus, l’inclusivité et la localisation, au moins 50 % des fonds seront directement alloués à des organisa-tions nationales éligibles et solidement implantées dans les zones ciblées. Les ONG locales et nationales seront donc pleine-ment associées à la conception et à la mise en œuvre des projets, en tant que partenaires décisionnels.    Cette allocation du FH RCA illustre ainsi la volonté du Coordonnateur Humanitaire de promouvoir une approche de proximité, inclusive et coordonnée, valorisant le leadership des acteurs nationaux et la participation active des communautés à toutes les étapes du cycle de l’allocation, pour une aide plus pertinente, durable et efficace dans le sud-est de la RCA.

2025 Sixth Réserve Allocation,"Cette allocation s’inscrit dans la vision 2025 du Coordonnateur Humanitaire (CH) de la RCA et de la communauté humanitaire du pays, en combinant continuité opérationnelle, localisation, réponse rapide, approche sensible au genre et redevabilité. Elle vise également à renforcer les capacités des acteurs locaux, en particulier les organisations dirigées par des femmes (WLO), tout en maintenant la possibilité de répondre rapidement aux alertes humanitaires.            Les WLO, grâce à leur ancrage communautaire et leur présence dans les zones difficiles d’accès, jouent un rôle clé pour assurer la continuité de l’assistance et des réponses sensibles au genre. Cependant, leur accès limité aux financements directs (en raison de contraintes institutionnelles ou techniques) freine souvent leur potentiel.          Pour soutenir des réponses humanitaires pertinentes tout en consolidant la localisation et en renforçant le leadership des organisations féminines, le Coordonnateur Humanitaire, après consultation du Comité Consultatif du FH RCA, lance une allocation de $8 millions (dont un minimum de 45% directement pour les ONG Nationales incluant les WLO), visant à :     Maintenir une capacité opérationnelle dans les zones prioritaires où les partenaires restent disponibles et pertinents ;     Financer directement des réponses menées par des WLO, notamment dans les zones où l’accès est limité ;     Renforcer les capacités institutionnelles et techniques des WLO, y compris via des projets portés par d’autres acteurs ;     Prioriser les zones ayant généré le plus grand nombre d’alertes humanitaires et touchant le plus grand nombre de personnes au cours des 12 derniers mois ;     Préserver une capacité de réponse rapide, permettant de traiter les besoins déjà identifiés ainsi que les nouvelles alertes.          Cette approche permettra de maintenir la présence humanitaire, de renforcer le leadership des WLO et d’assurer une allocation flexible et réactive, tout en contribuant à l’agenda de localisation et à la protection des populations.

2025 Third Reserve Allocation,"Face à la persistance de la crise humanitaire complexe en République centrafricaine — marquée par des conflits prolongés, des déplacements massifs, une insécurité chronique et un accès limité aux services de base — il est plus que jamais nécessaire de recentrer l’action humanitaire sur les communautés affectées elles-mêmes. Malgré les efforts constants, les populations continuent de faire face à des besoins multiples et interdépendants qui exigent des réponses adaptées, participatives et ancrées dans leur réalité quotidienne, reflétant en priorité leurs besoins et perspectives exprimés sur le terrain.     Dans ce contexte, le Coordonnateur Humanitaire (CH) pour la RCA, en concertation avec le Comité Consultatif du FH RCA, lance une allocation de réserve de 400 000 USD pour renforcer et opérationnaliser les mécanismes collectifs de redevabilité communautaire dans plusieurs localités des préfectures de l’Ouham, de l’Ouham-Fafa, de l’Ouham Pendé et de la Vakaga. Elle viendra compléter les dispositifs déjà actifs dans d’autres zones prioritaires du HNRP 2025 et garantir l’association des populations affectées (près de 600 000 personnes) à la planification, au suivi et à l’évaluation des interventions. Cette approche est aussi en lien avec la vision du CH pour le FH RCA et s’aligne parfaitement avec le « Humanitarian Reset » pour une proximité opérationnelle entre les acteurs humanitaires et les communautés.     L’allocation inclut un volet de sensibilisation et de renforcement des capacités des acteurs humanitaires sur les concepts clés d’AAP, les normes minimales d’engagement communautaire et la gestion des feedbacks communautaires. Elle mettra l’accent sur des systèmes agiles permettant que les retours des communautés en temps réel soient intégrés dans la prise de décision, tout en renforçant les partenariats stratégiques avec les organisations locales et nationales pour une redevabilité plus pertinente, inclusive et durable.     Enfin, par le pilotage et l’extension d’outils numériques favorisant la communication bidirectionnelle avec les populations affectées, ce financement s’inscrit pleinement dans la vision 2025 d’une réponse humanitaire de qualité, inclusive, localisée et centrée sur les personnes affectées, consolidant la confiance entre communautés, acteurs humanitaires et bailleurs.",Reserve,400000,9/23/2025 12:00:00 AM,10/31/2025 12:00:00 AM,FH RCA_RA3 2025_Annexe 3_Directives du HC sur integration budgetisation PSEA.pdf##95233##Allocation Type##https://onegms.unocha.org/pubdocs/Allocationsdocs/CAR-AllocDocs_2025_1497_1464.pdf##|||FH RCA_RA3 2025_Annexe 2_Stratégie AAP collectif 2025 du GTAAP.pdf##121359##Allocation Type##https://onegms.unocha.org/pubdocs/Allocationsdocs/CAR-AllocDocs_2025_1497_1465.pdf##|||FH RCA_RA3 2025_Annexe 1_Modalités opérationnelles_Version 23 Juin 2025.pdf##137868##Allocation Type##https://onegms.unocha.org/pubdocs/Allocationsdocs/CAR-AllocDocs_2025_1497_1466.pdf##|||FH RCA_RA3_Note stratégique_Version Finale pour OneGMS.pdf##444177##Allocation Type##https://onegms.unocha.org/pubdocs/Allocationsdocs/CAR-AllocDocs_2025_1497_1467.pdf##,17,CAR,2025,République Centrafricaine Besoins Humanitaires et ##2025,10/31/2025 12:00:00 AM,0,0,1,400000,1497,1,1
Second Reserve Allocation,"Dans un contexte de contamination croissante par les engins explosifs dans l’Ouham-Pendé, notamment autour de Bocaranga Koui et Ngaoundaye, les populations civiles sont exposées à un risque mortel quotidien. Depuis 2021, l’usage accru d’engins explosifs improvisés (EEI) par des groupes armés a entraîné des déplacements massifs, des pertes en vies humaines et freiné l’accès humanitaire.    En réponse à cette menace, le Coordonnateur humanitaire avait alloué en 2024 un financement à l’ONGI Handicap et Inclusion, mais le projet n’a pas abouti suite à la fermeture de son bureau en RCA. En 2025, il mobilise 600 000 USD du Fonds humanitaire pour appuyer la continuité de cette intervention axée sur deux volets clés:  •	L’éducation aux risques liés aux restes d’explosifs de guerre (REG), pour prévenir les accidents et sauver des vies, notamment via des actions adaptées aux zones rurales et aux faibles niveaux d’alphabétisation.  •	Le renforcement des capacités d’acteurs locaux, en leur fournissant les outils, formations et moyens pour devenir des relais communautaires de prévention et de réponse.    Cette allocation vise à protéger les civils, en particulier les enfants et les agriculteurs, tout en posant les bases d’une culture de sécurité locale. Elle s’inscrit dans une stratégie plus large de stabilisation de l’Ouham-Pendé, en misant sur la proximité, la prévention et l’appropriation communautaire.

Ces populations ont choisi de fuir vers des localités situées dans la voisine Zone de santé de Mutwanga (à l’est du Territoire de Beni). La vague la plus importante de ces personnes a décidé de chercher refuge dans six (6) des 14 aires de santé de Kamango (de 57 800 habitants) où les autorités locales ont une capacité limitée de fournir une réponse appropriée aux besoins identifiés de ces populations vulnérables. La majorité des déplacés – dont une partie se trouve en familles d’accueil et l’autre dans des sites publics, tels que les écoles, les églises et les formations sanitaires – vivent dans une situation de forte précarité. Avec la persistance du conflit armé dans la zone, le nombre de déplaces ne cesse d’augmenter.  En conséquence, les familles déplacées et comme les familles hôtes font face à une dégradation de leur situation alimentaire.

UR septembre 2020 - Allocation Reserve – Nyunzu,"Pour soutenir le Plan de Réponse Humanitaire (PRH) susmentionné, et en étroite collaboration avec le Conseil Consultatif (CC) du FH RDC, le Coordonnateur Humanitaire (CH) a approuvé une Allocation de Reserve (AR) de 2 millions de dollars américains en vue de répondre aux nouveaux besoins récents et imminents des populations les plus vulnérables dans la Province de Nyunzu, à la suite de la détérioration récente de la situation humanitaire.   L’allocation permettra ainsi de soutenir, pour une courte durée (6 mois), l’adaptation de la stratégie d’intervention des partenaires à l’évolution de la crise- en ligne avec la stratégie du Cluster, dans les zones où les partenaires du FH RDC sont déjà présents.     Les interventions sont priorisées dans le cadre de cette allocation et les critères de choix des zones identifiées prioritaires ont été établis en fonction des aspects suivants :  1.	Criticité temporelle : l'allocation priorise les projets proposant des besoins qui nécessitent une réponse immédiate et qui ne peut pas être reportée.  2.	Complémentarité avec d’autres sources de financement : cette allocation assure une utilisation complémentaire du Fonds avec d'autres sources de financement, notamment la 1ere allocation standard du FH RDC en cours en termes de ciblage géographique et activités priorisées.   3.	Présence opérationnelle  et accès des partenaires : La priorisation a pris en compte la faible capacité de réponse des acteurs comparé à l’ampleur des crises et du fait de la dégradation de la situation humanitaire des populations de ces zones. Par conséquence, les interventions financées seront mises en place par des partenaires dont la présence opérationnelle est confirmée et dont l'accès aux zones géographiques prioritaires est accordé. A noter que le nombre des alertes sur les cas de violations de droits affectant les plus vulnérables a augmenté dans les territoires ou la réponse reste très limitée ou inexistante.

Comparé à d'autres crises, il a été observé dans certaines zones de santé du Nord-Kivu que les personnes fuyant ces atrocités restent déplacées beaucoup plus longtemps qu'ailleurs au Congo.     De ce qui précède, le Coordonnateur humanitaire (CH) a décidé de mettre à disposition un montant maximal de 8 millions de dollars américains pour une allocation réserve afin répondre aux besoins humanitaires urgents et persistants des populations les plus affectées.

Depuis le déclenchement de la crise, les acteurs humanitaires ainsi que le gouvernement de la RDC travaillent sur place pour soulager les populations sinistrées en assurant, en priorité, l’enterrement sécurisé des corps afin d’éviter la propagation des maladies. Selon les premières conclusions d'une mission d'évaluation conjointe, les besoins les plus immédiats incluent : le soutien en eau, l’hygiène et assainissement, avec une priorité dans la fourniture d’eau potable ; le soutien en soins de santé à travers les intrants médicaux et la prise en charge des blessés ; l'aide alimentaire à travers un soutien en vivres, les abris et articles ménagers essentiels ; auxquels s’ajoutent un soutien en faveur des enfants non accompagnés.  Il sied de noter que la zone touchée par le désastre naturel est également une zone endémique au choléra et où la rougeole prend une tournure inquiétante, notamment dans la zone de santé de Kalehe où 1098 cas ont été rapportés depuis le début de l’année 2023. En plus, cette zone compte 107 700 personnes déplacées, parmi lesquelles des milliers en provenance du Nord Kivu où elles ont fui le conflit armé entre le M23 et les FARDC. Le contexte décrit ci-dessus constitue donc un facteur aggravant pour la crise et pourrait en faire durer les conséquences sur des populations déjà affectées physiquement et psychologiquement. Ce chiffre de 3 000 ménages est susceptible d’évoluer au milieu de la mise en œuvre après la réception de nouvelles informations sur cette crise.",Reserve,3000000,5/15/2023 12:00:00 AM,6/6/2023 12:00:00 AM,FH RDC AR 1_2023_ Stratégie Inondation Kalehe.pdf##311712##Allocation Type##https://onegms.unocha.org/pubdocs/Allocationsdocs/DRC-AllocDocs_2023_472_798.pdf##|||Annex A_Preparation Budget_Strategie d'Allocation Reserve 1.pdf##300643##Allocation Type##https://onegms.unocha.org/pubdocs/Allocationsdocs/DRC-AllocDocs_2023_472_799.pdf##,24,DRC,2023,République Démocratique du Congo Plan de Réponse H##2023,6/6/2023 12:00:00 AM,0,0,6,3000000,472,1,1

L’intensification des combats et la dégradation des conditions de vie des populations dans le territoire de Djugu durant les mois de juin et juillet rendent cette allocation urgent et pertinente.  A travers une approche intégrée et la promotion du dialogue et de la réconciliation intercommunautaire, cette allocation permettra de soutenir les moyens de subsistance des familles affectées et de renforcer leur résilience, afin de réduire leur dépendance de l’aide humanitaire et de soutenir un développement socio-économique.

RA5-Déc 2024-Réponse multisectorielle d’urgence aux besoins prioritaires des personnes affectées par la crise dans les territoires de Kabambare (Maniema) et Kongolo (Tanganyika),"L’activisme des groupes armés dans le territoire de Kabambare (province de Maniema), notamment des Maï-Maï Malaïka perturbe l'accès aux services de base et aggrave la vulnérabilité des populations locales, impactant également le territoire voisin de Kongolo dans la province de Tanganyika. Entre juillet 2023 et juillet 2024, les violences et exactions commises contre les populations civiles ont occasionné le déplacement interne de près de 322 000 personnes et 77 000 retournées, dont 67% dans le territoire de Kabambare. Ces populations impactées par la crise avec des besoins multisectoriels importants, demeurent sans assistance depuis des mois à cause du manque de ressources, des contraintes logistiques, d’accès et de sécurité qui limitent la capacité des humanitaires à intervenir dans ces zones.    Dans ce contexte fortement impacté par la rareté des financements, cette cinquième allocation réserve du FH RDC d’une enveloppe de 4,7 millions USD permettra d’apporter une réponse d’urgence et multisectorielle aux populations impactées par la crise dans les territoires de Kabambare (province du Maniema) et Kongolo (province du Tanganyika).     L’analyse du contexte humanitaire des zones concernées confirme un accès limité, et bien souvent inexistant, aux services et aux biens en raison de l’insécurité et aux contraintes logistiques.  Les besoins humanitaires demeurent significatifs et sont prioritaires dans les secteurs d’Abris et AME, d’Eau, Hygiène et Assainissement (EHA), de santé et nutrition, de sécurité alimentaire et moyens de subsistance, et de protection (VBG et PE). Compte tenu de ces besoins et des ressources disponibles, la stratégie de réponse de la présente allocation se focalisera sur les priorités suivantes : (1) le renforcement des moyens de subsistance et l’accès à la nourriture ; (2) l’amélioration de l’accès à l’eau et des conditions d’hygiène et de salubrité adéquate ; (3) l’accès aux abris et articles ménagers essentiels ;4) l’accès aux soins de santé et à une prise en charge nutritionnelle adéquate ; 5) la protection des communautés contre les violences basées sur le genre et la protection de l’enfance.

RA6 - Déc 2024 - Réponse précoce « 48 heures » face aux risques d'inondations,"La présente stratégie vise à piloter une réponse précoce dans un délai de « 48 heures » aux risques d'inondation en République Démocratique du Congo (RDC) dans le cadre de la planification des urgences humanitaires.   Pour faire face aux conséquences des précipitations excédentaires pour la période d’octobre à décembre 2024, principalement dans les zones riveraines et lacustres du Sud-Kivu, Tanganyika, Tshopo, Haut-Uelé, Bas-Uelé et Equateur, il apparait opportun pour le FH RDC de piloter cette initiative visant à prépositionner les ressources nécessaires afin de minimiser l’impact négatif que pourraient avoir les inondations sur des communautés vulnérables déjà affectées, et ce, dans un délai extrêmement court.   Compte tenu des ressources disponibles, cette initiative permettra de piloter pour la première fois une action anticipatoire sous forme de réponse précoce, sous le FH RDC pour une enveloppe dédiée de 1,3 million USD dans les provinces de la Tshopo, du Bas-Uélé et du haut-Uélé (zone 1), dans les provinces du Nord Kivu et du Sud-Kivu (zone 2) et dans la province du Tanganyika (zone 3). Il s’agira de prépositionner des ressources financières pour trois partenaires présélectionnés ou moins (idéalement un partenaire par zone retenue) à l’issue d’un appel à projets pour une réponse dans un délai de 48 heures suivant l’impact des risques liés aux inondations sur les communautés vulnérables dans les zones déjà affectées par la crise humanitaire. En outre, cette allocation spéciale offre l’opportunité de s’appuyer sur une approche anticipatoire et flexible, garantissant une réponse rapide et coordonnée pour minimiser les pertes humaines et répondre aux besoins les plus essentiels dans un délai de48 heures. Enfin, le pilotage de cette allocation spéciale permettra d’éviter un processus d’allocation long et laborieux, incapable de garantir une réponse efficace et opérationnelle dès que les seuils d'impact des inondations sont atteints, selon les leçons tirées des inondations et réponses aux inondations en 2023.",Reserve,1300000,12/30/2024 12:00:00 AM,1/31/2025 12:00:00 AM,Annexe I_ FH RDC_Preparation Budget.pdf##154570##Allocation Type##https://onegms.unocha.org/pubdocs/Allocationsdocs/DRC-AllocDocs_2024_1385_1209.pdf##|||Annexe II_FH RDC_Note d'orientation AAP PSEA VBG Genre Inclusion.pdf##648677##Allocation Type##https://onegms.unocha.org/pubdocs/Allocationsdocs/DRC-AllocDocs_2024_1385_1210.pdf##|||Annexe III - Rapport des audits de securite VBG- 20 Juillet 2023 - RA6 2024.pdf##3859160##Allocation Type##https://onegms.unocha.org/pubdocs/Allocationsdocs/DRC-AllocDocs_2024_1385_1211.pdf##|||Annexe IV - Modalités opérationnelles.pdf##326377##Allocation Type##https://onegms.unocha.org/pubdocs/Allocationsdocs/DRC-AllocDocs_2024_1385_1212.pdf##|||Annexe 8 - Cadre logique de non-conformité.pdf##1589275##Allocation Type##https://onegms.unocha.org/pubdocs/Allocationsdocs/DRC-AllocDocs_2024_1385_1213.pdf##|||Annexe 9 - Cadre logique Gestion de la fraude et mauvaise - RA6 2024.pdf##265621##Allocation Type##https://onegms.unocha.org/pubdocs/Allocationsdocs/DRC-AllocDocs_2024_1385_1214.pdf##|||Annexe 10 - Cadre logique pour la gestion de cas de SEA.pdf##272428##Allocation Type##https://onegms.unocha.org/pubdocs/Allocationsdocs/DRC-AllocDocs_2024_1385_1215.pdf##|||20241218_FHDRC_AR6_Document stratégique - Réponse précoce 48 heures aux risques inondations VF.pdf##805935##Allocation Type##https://onegms.unocha.org/pubdocs/Allocationsdocs/DRC-AllocDocs_2024_1385_1217.pdf##,24,DRC,2024,République Démocratique du Congo Plan de Réponse H##2024,1/31/2025 12:00:00 AM,0,0,0,0,1385,1,1

"RA1 - Avril 2025 - Réponse humanitaire multisectorielle aux besoins des populations déplacés retournées et communautés hôtes dans les provinces du Nord-Kivu, Sud-Kivu et Ituri","Depuis janvier 2025, la dégradation accélérée de la situation sécuritaire à l’Est de la République Démocratique du Congo, marquée par la prise stratégique des principales villes par le M23, comme Goma, et Bukavu, a provoqué le déplacement de plus de 850 000 personnes. Parallèlement, la fermeture forcée des sites de déplacés autour de Goma a entraîné des retours précipités, souvent non volontaires, aggravant la vulnérabilité des populations déjà fragilisées par des décennies de crise. En Ituri, l’escalade des violences des groupes armées et des tensions intercommunautaires a généré plus de 108 700 nouveaux déplacements, exacerbant une situation humanitaire déjà critique.  C’est dans ce contexte que cette Première Allocation de Réserve 2025 du Fonds Humanitaire en RDC (FH RDC), d’un montant de 20 millions USD a été validée avec une enveloppe répartie comme suit : Nord Kivu (7 millions de USD) ; Sud Kivu (6 millions) et Ituri (7 Millions) afin de fournir les ressources permettant d’adresser les priorités suivantes :  •	Contribuer à une mise à l’échelle de la réponse humanitaire en adressant les besoins vitaux des populations les plus vulnérables (personnes déplacées, personnes retournées et communautés hôtes) affectées par les derniers développements sécuritaires dans les provinces de l’Ituri, du Nord et du Sud-Kivu, consécutive à l’activisme du M23 et des autres groupes armés ;   •	Prendre en compte les zones non-couvertes par les financements actuels, y compris la récente allocation CERF Rapid Response 2025 de 17 millions USD en adressant les besoins les plus critiques des populations affectées par la crise ;  •	Renforcer la résilience des populations touchées par la crise, avec une attention particulière sur les populations déplacées internes et les retournés en fournissant un appui multisectoriel visant à faciliter leur réintégration progressive et de façon durable dans les communautés hôtes ou d’origine.

2023 1st EHF Reserve Allocation,"As recalled during the High Level Pledging Event on the Horn of Africa on 24 May, the urgency to further scale up the response in   drought-affected southern and eastern Ethiopia remains high. Despite recent rainfall in parts of these areas, the humanitarian condition   of the affected population – including pastoralists and agro-pastoralists – remains extremely dire as their livelihoods have been severely   affected. Communities are suffering the impacts of five consecutive poor rainy seasons, coming on top of conflict and insecurity, high   food prices and other drivers of needs including most recently off-season floods and a cholera epidemic. Access to basic needs, such as   food and water, for many households is expected to continue to be extremely limited and continues to require urgent humanitarian   assistance. In a context that continues to evolve and compounded by recent droughts and floods, it is estimated that 13 million are in   dire need of humanitarian assistance1  .  To bolster the humanitarian response in these areas, the Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund (EHF) is activating a $17 million Reserve Allocation   to prevent further deterioration in food security, water supplies and sanitation, as well as support the initial rebuilding of essential   livelihoods and enhance safety and dignity of populations.

Early action is needed to prevent deterioration and widespread suffering. Conflict and insecurity in several parts of the country has given rise to new and growing protection concerns, including displacement, destruction of social infrastructure, and gender-based violence. The Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund (EHF) is launching a standard allocation of US$30 million to kickstart the response to newly prioritized humanitarian needs1, targeting locations in Afar, Amhara, Oromia, Somali and Tigray regions that meet the following criteria: 1) drought-affected, 2) hotspot woredas, and 3) no or limited operational presence. The allocation complements the $17 million CERF allocation that provided support to the drought response in early 2024. The allocation also supports the humanitarian scale up in East and Kelem Wellegas in Western Oromia where there are ongoing new displacements due to active conflict and significant gaps have been identified in the response. The allocation adopts an area-based approach, promoting an intersectoral response to save lives. It will advance localization through funding NNGOs as directly as possible, and prioritizing consortia/partnerships that add value in terms of capacity-strengthening and ensuring an intersectoral approach.

2025 Second Reserve Allocation,"The Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund (EHF) is launching the 2025 Second Reserve Allocation of up to US$6 million to address critical, life-threatening humanitarian needs in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia. This allocation responds to deteriorating conditions linked to sustained displacement, funding shortfalls, collapsing service pipelines and heightened vulnerability ahead of the rainy season.   As of early April 2025, Tigray hosts more than 20% of Ethiopia’s IDP population and more than 40% of its returnees1. With approximately 700,000 internally displaced people facing severe gaps in shelter, WASH, nutrition, health and protection services, this allocation prioritizes a multi-sectoral response targeting the most affected people in collective sites and underserved areas. It aims to mitigate the risks of disease outbreaks, malnutrition and protection contravention, particularly gender-based violence—through integrated area-based interventions.  Timely and flexible support through this allocation will help partners sustain essential life-saving services, scale up preparedness efforts and prevent further deterioration in one of the most complex operating environments in the country. The allocation is launched in parallel to the 2025 First Standard Allocation that addresses priority needs in other parts of the country. The reserve allocation modality with pre-identified partners has been selected to ensure timely delivery of assistance to people affected by critical humanitarian needs.

Firstly, it aims to deliver multisectoral support in prioritized sites for internally displaced people, including collective centres in Amhara and Tigray, and informal settlements in Somali and Oromia, with particular emphasis on border conflict-affected zones. Secondly, it provides time-bound humanitarian assistance – in areas of voluntary return of internally displaced people to Eastern Tigray and Western Oromia, where conditions meet humanitarian principles and access to basic services remains constrained.

Given the limited funding available, the allocation will use a targeted multi-sectoral approach to maximize its impact in specific underserved areas and areas of high severity needs.     This allocation will strengthen ongoing responses in health, multipurpose cash assistance, protection, and WASH clusters to reduce reliance on negative coping mechanisms among targeted groups. The allocation will also support IHF’s continued pursuit of the Grand Bargain commitment on localization through promoting submissions from national and international NGOs (INGOs) as first responders. INGOs are further expected to invest in building the capacity of national NGOs with whom they will partner.

2021 1st Standard Allocation,"This allocation aims to provide vulnerable returnees and out-of-camp IDPs in Iraq in underserved locations with targeted protection assistance, improved access to essential health and WASH services, and emergency livelihood support through humanitarian partners investing in localized response. The allocation has an overall objective to address issues driving an increase in severity of humanitarian needs in Iraq over the past year, such as increased protection concerns, deteriorated access to key Health and WASH services, and loss of income, which result in increased negative coping mechanisms. It will jumpstart the implementation of key recommendations from the recently completed 2020 HRP gap analysis of the ICCG, through strategically targeting returnees in severe need and out-of-camp IDPs in underserved locations with focused sectoral response prioritized under the 2021 HRP. Beyond immediate operational priorities, the allocation will support the IHF’s continued pursuit of the Grand Bargain commitment on localization through promoting multi-NGO consortia as a preferred funding modality, aimed at enhancing the participation and capacity of national partners. Finally, in line with the Fund’s second strategic objective for 2021, the allocation aims to channel funds to underfunded areas of humanitarian response, through prioritizing projects which mainstream gender (especially women and girls), specific needs of persons with disability, and GBV.",Standard,1.35E+07,4/26/2021 12:00:00 AM,7/2/2021 12:00:00 AM,IHF 2021 1st Standard Allocation Strategy_FINAL_Timeline extended.pdf##355828##Allocation Type##https://onegms.unocha.org/pubdocs/Allocationsdocs/IRQ-AllocDocs_2021_326_486.pdf##,72,Iraq,2021,Iraq Humanitarian Response Plan 2021##2021,7/2/2021 12:00:00 AM,0,0,11,1.349818E+07,326,2,1
2022 1st Standard Allocation,"In cognizance of the significant residual humanitarian needs among extremely vulnerable Iraqis, against the context of response transition, this last allocation of the Iraq Humanitarian Fund (IHF) will support vulnerable internally displaced persons (IDPs) living outside camps and returnees in acute need in accessing: 1) immediate income sources to meet basic needs and reduce reliance on negative coping strategies; 2) specialized protection services; and 3) water and sanitation services focusing on minimal service provision to address life-threatening needs and sustainable community-level solutions.     Leveraging the Fund’s comparative advantage of timeliness and flexibility, and its wide network of partners, the allocation will help address the core drivers of vulnerability among these groups through high-impact, short-term interventions. By targeting nine districts that host the highest numbers of targeted population groups in acute need, yet with significant response gaps, the allocation will maximize the impact of limited funding available. The tight sectoral and geographic focus complements ongoing and planned interventions by other donor and international agency initiatives.    The allocation will also support the continued pursuit of the Fund’s commitment to localization, through promoting participation and capacity-strengthening of national partners, as well as other cross-cutting priorities including gender and age considerations, disability inclusion, protection mainstreaming, and accountability in all partner programming.",Standard,8400000,6/1/2022 12:00:00 AM,7/31/2022 12:00:00 AM,IHF 2022 First Standard Allocation Strategy_final.pdf##353882##Allocation Type##https://onegms.unocha.org/pubdocs/Allocationsdocs/IRQ-AllocDocs_2022_412_552.pdf##|||List of IHF-eligible partners as of 220120_EXTERNAL.pdf##176478##Allocation Type##https://onegms.unocha.org/pubdocs/Allocationsdocs/IRQ-AllocDocs_2022_412_553.pdf##,72,Iraq,2022,Iraq Humanitarian Response Plan 2022##2022,7/31/2022 12:00:00 AM,0,0,9,8386519,412,2,1

Tdh has over the past months approached several donors to seek funding to sustain its interventions in EJC. Concretely, Tdh has together with DRC approached ECHO, who have indicated that funding may likely be available as of January 2020 and who will visit EJC later in the month. Also, Tdh will apply for the second allocation of the JHF once made available – funding for this would however also not be available before January 2020.

2021 1st Reserve Allocation,"a)	Multi-sector Needs Assessment: ($450,000) / REACH &amp; IOM)  The Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) tasked OCHA to undertake a Multi Sector Needs Analysis (MSNA) exercise to provide a comprehensive evidence base of multi-sectoral needs amongst different population groups in Lebanon to help understand the scale and severity of the current crisis. It is the intention of the Humanitarian Coordinator to use the LHF Reserve modality to co-fund the proposed MSNA, which will aim to achieve the following objectives:    1. Inform humanitarian-development response options for 2021/2 planning, through the provision of comprehensive, multi-sectoral household data  2. Provide inter-sectoral analysis of the severity of humanitarian needs among crisis-affected populations in Lebanon, including the calculation of People in Need and severity calculations to enable inter-sectoral prioritization and programming  3. Improve the quality of humanitarian data in Lebanon for use by humanitarian and development actors    Already in progress, initial findings from the MSNA will be available by October 2021, and full analysis published at the end of the year. The Assessment will support a revision of the 12-month coordinated multi-sectoral Emergency Response Plan (ERP) currently under preparation to address the needs of the most vulnerable among the Lebanese, Palestine Refugees from Lebanon (PRL) and migrants affected by the crisis, in complement to the LCRP as the framework to address the impact of the Syria crisis in Lebanon. As an HCT-owned and led assessment, the MSNA process will continue to involve all relevant stakeholders at both strategic and operational levels to avoid duplication and ensure complementarity with ongoing assessments, including the Vulnerability Assessment of Syrian Refugees in Lebanon (VASyR) and the planned Lebanon Vulnerable Assessment Panel (LVAP).     b)	Strengthened national NGO Coordination and engagement in ‘Whole of Lebanon’ response: ($100,000 / Lebanon Humanitarian and Development Forum)  To support the continued engagement of national responders in all levels of a coordinated ‘Whole of Lebanon’ response, $100,000 will also be made available to support the Lebanon Humanitarian and Development Forum (LHDF).   As the humanitarian community seeks to respond to emerging needs among previously unsupported caseloads, the LHDF and its membership will play a critical role in ensuring the full engagement of local and national partners in the response.  Funding will also support the ongoing work of the Forum in facilitating its core coordination, capacity building, advocacy, PSEA and community help desk and hotline activities, as well as to play a role in supporting local partners submissions to the LHF. Funding will also support LHDF to work with members in mainstreaming key cross-cutting issues (notably gender, AAP and PSEA) among LHF local partner programming.

2024 2nd Reserve Allocation,"Two weeks after the cessation of hostilities was announced on 27 November 2024, Lebanon continues to grapple with an increasingly complex humanitarian situation. The scale of damage, of people displaced and returning to their communities in conflict-affected areas means that urgent needs continue to unfold. As winter approaces, needs are becoming increasingly acute, compounding the barriers people already face in accessing services.  Since 8 October 2023, the conflict has killed 4,047 civilians, including at least 290 children and 790 women, injured 16,638 and directly impacted more than 1.3 million people.    The Lebanon Humanitarian Fund (LHF) is launching a $30.7 million emergency allocation to supplement $12 million allocated in October to upscale and expand humanitarian response to all those impacted by the crisis. The allocation will deliver flexible, timely multi-sectoral interventions through NGO partners to address immediate and life-saving humanitarian needs. Funding will support all population groups – Lebanese, Syrian and Palestine refugees and migrants - those remaining in areas of displacement, those in transition trying to return home but unable to do so, those returning home and those who never left conflict-affected areas. Support will prioritize locations most impacted by the conflict considering revised displacement figures with flexibility provided to allow for the fluidity of the context.   To ensure a timely allocation process, the allocation will support pre-identified partners chosen via an inclusive consultation process informed by sub-national inputs to ensure the delivery of a contextualized response.

2023 First Reserve Allocation,"The passage of Cyclone Mocha left a trail of destruction across multiple states and regions in Myanmar’s west, affecting an estimated 5.4 million people, 3.2 million of whom are considered highly vulnerable. After years of protracted conflict, compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic, affected people in the hardest-hit communities have very weak coping capacity and reduced ability to recover from the storm’s multi-faceted impacts without immediate, lifesaving assistance. This allocation provides time-critical funding to select partners with sustained access and a proven ability to deliver timely aid in affected areas to help kickstart emergency response activities that will save lives and alleviate suffering.    Through this allocation, the MHF aims to provide critical support through Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA), where appropriate and feasible, and/or the delivery of emergency Health, Shelter/NFI and WASH supplies to displaced and vulnerable people. Current levels of funding for these clusters cannot effectively cover emerging needs, making this allocation both timely and indispensable in preventing a further deterioration in an already dire humanitarian situation.     Underfunding, import restrictions and poor access have compromised the ability of humanitarians to stockpile and pre-position emergency supplies over the past two years. Against this challenging logistics backdrop, the allocation prioritizes the distribution of CVA and/or locally-procured relief items, including emergency shelter kits and NFIs, medicines and medical supplies as well as safe water and hygiene items, among other commodities, to facilitate a quick response and avoid bureaucratic hurdles around imports. Any surplus relief items after the Cyclone Mocha response will be strategically pre-positioned to facilitate responses to seasonal flooding and storms over the course of the monsoon season which runs from May through October, enhancing response preparedness.      While preliminary analysis has identified Health, Shelter/NFI and WASH as priority clusters for the disaster response, these clusters are also among the most underfunded in the 2023 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP). According to OCHA’s Financial Tracking Service (FTS), as of 15 May, these clusters face a combined funding shortfall of about $303.1 million. WASH has only secured $2.6 million (2 per cent of required funding) and Health has received just $700,000 (less than 1 per cent of required funding), while Shelter/NFI has yet to receive any funding through the 2023 HRP.

2023 First Standard Allocation,"Intensifying conflict, the active monsoon season and the premature closure of displacement camps by the de facto authorities, will see more people on the move, new vulnerabilities and the aggravation of pre-existing needs. The passage of Cyclone Mocha has only worsened an already dire humanitarian situation in Rakhine, the Northwest, and Northeast, triggering fresh displacement, damaging or destroying homes and community infrastructure, and disrupting already fragile livelihoods. At such a critical juncture, this allocation provides timely funding to the partners who are best-placed to enable a swift response to worsening humanitarian conditions, helping to prevent a further accumulation of unmet needs and growing reliance on negative coping mechanisms.     Through this allocation, the MHF aims to provide a comprehensive package of multi-sectoral assistance to people in need. Using an area-based approach, this allocation prioritizes hard-to-reach townships where displacement, needs and response gaps are highest, across the Northwest, Southeast, Northeast and Rakhine. It aims to improve access by directing funding to local partners and incentivizing partnerships with these organizations through sub-granting to reach more people, more quickly. Additionally, the allocation encourages the use of Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA), where appropriate and feasible, to help overcome access challenges and promote the safety and dignity of affected populations.     So far this year, the 2023 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) has only received US$74.9 million (10 per cent) of the $764.3 million total funding requirement. Amid continued underfunding, the disbursement of $18.25 million through this allocation – nearly a quarter of the funding secured against the 2023 HRP so far – will provide a much-needed injection of resources for humanitarian partners. This will help kickstart lifesaving response activities and channel increased funding to local organizations who have superior access and a proven ability to reach people in need but who face resource mobilization challenges.     In line with the strategy and priorities of the 2023 HRP, all projects funded under this allocation must ensure that the centrality of protection and disability inclusion are integrated into their proposals and activities. The Fund will promote the mainstreaming of explosive ordnance risk education as well as mental health and psychosocial support, encouraging partners to meaningfully incorporate relevant activities in their projects.

2023 Fourth Reserve Allocation,"Since 26 October, fighting between the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) and various ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) has significantly intensified in northern Shan, displacing more than 23,000 people, a figure likely to increase in the days and weeks to come as active fighting is expected to persist, including the use of heavy weapons and airstrikes. This sudden and significant increase in humanitarian needs and protection risks is quickly outstripping the limited resources of partners in northern Shan, as the state has not been prioritized for funding in recent years, including through previous CERF and MHF allocations. As such, a swift injection of additional funding is required to enable partners to deliver a response at scale and to prevent an accumulation of unmet needs amid a rapidly worsening humanitarian situation.     Against this backdrop, this allocation provides timely funding to pre-selected partners best-placed to quickly scale-up assistance to new IDPs affected by the recent escalation in conflict. Based on a preliminary analysis of needs and the prevailing access situation, this allocation will promote the provision of Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) and the local procurement of critical relief supplies, including food, medicines and medical supplies and NFIs, to ensure that assistance is quick, safely accessible and tailored to people’s needs. Additionally, given the rise of health and protection needs and risks, this allocation will support the provision of critical health and protection services, including mobile health clinics and mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS).

2023 Second Reserve Allocation,"Cyclone Mocha wrought devastation across Rakhine, the Northwest and Kachin. It caused significant damage to community infrastructure, disrupted vital services and undermined already fragile livelihoods, leaving a long road to recovery for affected populations with limited coping capacities to deal with this crisis within a crisis. At this critical juncture, MHF support is pivotal to help save lives, alleviate suffering, and restore critical services, infrastructure and livelihoods.     This $5 million allocation provides timely funding to pre-selected partners with sustained access and a proven ability to deliver aid in cyclone-affected areas of Rakhine, the Northwest and Kachin. The allocation strategically complements the MHF’s First Reserve Allocation for Cyclone Mocha, expanding the sectoral scope of the MHF-funded response while also supporting the transition to early recovery. It also strategically aligns with the prioritized activities and geographic scope of the Cyclone Mocha Flash Appeal.     The allocation prioritizes a combination of cash and in-kind assistance to improve access to education, protection and nutrition supplies and services for vulnerable children. It will also provide critical livelihood support and help jump-start early recovery efforts that will boost the local economy, generate income and rehabilitate essential community infrastructure. Additionally, it will add value by promoting the centrality of protection, helping scale-up child protection and Explosive Ordnance Risk Education responses while mainstreaming the prevention and response to gender-based violence.

2023 Second Standard Allocation,"Across Myanmar, intensified conflict along with heavy monsoon rains and flooding have triggered rising needs and displacement. This deterioration in the humanitarian situation comes as the most vulnerable are still reeling from the multi-faceted impacts of Cyclone Mocha in May. Against this backdrop, this allocation provides timely funding to scale-up assistance in areas that are difficult to access which have been recently affected by conflict and/or flooding. In particular, townships where people have experienced multiple displacements will be prioritized for urgent assistance to reduce the adoption of negative coping mechanisms and help save lives.    In line with the Humanitarian Coordinator’s (HC) Vision Paper for the Fund, this US$8 million allocation aims to facilitate the delivery of multi-sectoral assistance in difficult to access locations and areas of high multiple displacement by earmarking $3 million in direct funding to local NGOs and promoting sub-granting arrangements as vehicles for amplifying access. Additionally, this allocation will promote disability inclusion and explosive ordnance risk education (EORE), as a lack of capacity and resources continues to limit the mainstreaming of these key cross-cutting issues promoted by the Inter-Cluster Coordination Group (ICCG) and MHF.

2023 Third Reserve Allocation,"Within the context of unprecedented political, socioeconomic and humanitarian crisis, the role of local and national NGOs in Myanmar has become increasingly critical to ensuring a context-appropriate humanitarian response. Recognizing this, enhanced localization will entail meaningful and sustained engagement of local partners in the decision-making and coordination of humanitarian operations through removing language barriers. To do so, the Myanmar Humanitarian Fund (MHF) will allocate funds for continuation of specialized interpretation and translation services that will support the inter-agency coordination of humanitarian efforts. This service will also enhance trust and transparency within the humanitarian community through strengthening data collection, data security and reporting as part of the 2024 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP). Additionally, in line with recommendations from the Inter-Cluster Coordination Group (ICCG), the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) and the recent Peer-2-Peer report, the MHF will allocate funds to support the rollout of Activity Info software to establish a common platform to optimize the reporting process to ensure it is streamlined, consistent across clusters, enhances data security and simplifies procedures for humanitarian partners.

2024 First Reserve Allocation,"Since October 2023, conflict has expanded and intensified across vast swathes of the country, driving new displacement and worsening humanitarian needs. With very little carryover of funds into quarter one of 2024, UN agencies and humanitarian partners are strapped for resources, limiting their capacity to deliver a conflict response at scale or prepare for the disaster season ahead. Lack of funding threatens to propel a further accumulation of unmet needs that will leave affected people extremely vulnerable with the monsoon season just around corner.     Capitalizing on the agility and flexibility of the 48-hour response window, this allocation will enable pre-selected MHF partners to quickly assist people recently displaced by intensified clashes in Saging and Magway and support the procurement and pre-positioning of lifesaving aid in Rakhine to facilitate a rapid scale-up once access and security conditions permit. Amid chronic underfunding, many newly displaced in these locations have yet to receive assistance, making this allocation timely and urgent to help stave off an accumulation of unmet needs that will leave affected people even more vulnerable during the fast-approaching monsoon season. Projects will use a strategic combination of cash assistance and in-kind support to overcome access and logistics challenges where they arise and provide a flexible package of aid tailored to the local response landscape.     Through this timely injection of funding, the MHF will help sustain or potentially expand operational presence in these geographical areas, strengthen area-based coordination structures and improve response preparedness ahead of the monsoon season, adding value by bolstering response coordination and facilitating early action.

2024 First Standard Allocation,"As landmine and explosive ordnance (EO) contamination and related civilian casualties reach unprecedented levels in Myanmar, expanding explosive ordnance risk education (EORE) and disability inclusion across the response is critical and urgent. Given that a lack of capacity and resources is currently limiting efforts to mainstream and scale-up programme delivery in these key response-wide priorities, the HC has decided to allocate US$5,150,000 from the MHF to strengthen EORE and disability inclusion programming through a multi-year approach. This allocation will strategically linkup with the activities of the Mine Action Area of Responsibility (AoR) as well as the crucial work areas of the Technical Advisory Group on Disability Inclusion (TAG on DI) outlined in the 2024 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan (HNRP). Additionally, amid funding shortfalls, this allocation will support the roll out of the next nationwide Multi-Sectoral Needs Analysis (MSNA), providing timely funding to gather and analyze disaggregated data, including on disability, that will inform the 2025 Humanitarian Programme Cycle, including the 2025 HNRP, and Food Security and Nutrition Analysis. This funding will allow the MSNA team to provide a dedicated disability analysis earlier in the HPC process to better inform planning on disability inclusion, and continue to capture EO concerns among affected people.  Through this allocation, the MHF will provide support to partners in delivering response-wide technical guidance and capacity strengthening activities, including for humanitarian organizations, clusters, Area Humanitarian Country Teams (HCTs) and Area Inter-Cluster Coordination Groups (ICCGs). It will ensure a more inclusive, accessible and safe humanitarian response for all, while also providing tailored support to address the differentiated needs of landmine/EO survivors and persons with disabilities. This disability component recognizes that disability takes on many forms including not only physical impairment but also mental, visual, hearing and/or communication challenges. Priorities include setting up and/or strengthening survivor assistance centers, physical rehabilitation and mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) services, as well as inclusive livelihood support including through the use of cash and voucher assistance.

2024 Second Reserve Allocation,"Heavy rains caused by the monsoon season and remnants of Typhoon Yagi triggered severe flooding across Myanmar, affecting more than 1 million people countrywide. The floods have battered conflict areas with high pre-existing needs, leaving affected people extremely vulnerable and in urgent need of lifesaving aid. Using the 48-hour response modality, this allocation will provide timely funding to select partners, specifically local and international NGOs, who have sustained access and a proven ability to effectively deliver aid in flood-affected areas. In line with the MHF’s commitment to localization, 50 per cent ($2,500,000) of this allocation will be earmarked for direct funding to local partners.     Capitalizing on a joint CERF-MHF strategy development and prioritization process, this allocation strategically complements the recently launched CERF Rapid Response allocation ($4 million), ensuring maximum complementarity between these allocations to expand the sectoral coverage and impact of the flood response delivered through HC-managed pooled funds. This allocation will cover gaps in geographical coverage by targeting townships not covered by CERF and by bolstering response efforts in the hardest hit areas where needs are quickly outstripping the limited resources of partners. With bureaucratic impediments and procurement and logistics constraints making the delivery of in-kind relief supplies challenging, the use of cash-based assistance, including multi-purpose cash, will be prioritized wherever markets are functioning and accessible, promoting a quicker response for affected people that will have the added benefit of helping local markets recover.        In line with the HC’s Vision Paper, this allocation will mainstream the centrality of protection, including the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse as well as explosive ordnance risk education, as affected populations face heightened protection risks in the aftermath of the devastating floods, including from landmines and explosive ordnance that may have shifted during the floods, placing people on the move at increased risk of a landmine-related injuries or even death.",Reserve,5000000,11/26/2024 12:00:00 AM,12/5/2024 12:00:00 AM,2024-11-26_MHF Reserve Allocation Strategy (RA2)_Floods_FINAL.pdf##567911##Allocation Type##https://onegms.unocha.org/pubdocs/Allocationsdocs/MM-AllocDocs_2024_1358_1172.pdf##,59,Myanmar,2024,Myanmar Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan 2024##2024,12/5/2024 12:00:00 AM,0,0,6,4999964,1358,1,1
2025 First Reserve Allocation,"On 28 March, a powerful 7.7 magnitude earthquake rocked central Myanmar, killing more than 3,500 people, damaging or destroying scores of homes and cutting off access to crucial services. This devastating quake has significantly exacerbated already high levels of pre-existing needs in many areas already prioritized under the 2025 HNRP, requiring an immediate scale-up of the response to save lives, alleviate suffering and reduce vulnerabilities ahead of the fast-approaching monsoon season.  In support of the Flash HNRP Addendum, the MHF will launch an allocation of US$5 million through the 48-hour response window to support rapid, localized emergency response delivered by pre-selected partners with sustained access and capacity to reach the most vulnerable with multi-sectoral assistance. In line with the Humanitarian Reset, this allocation will prioritize funding for local partners, including lumpsum donations to local frontline responders, and cash-based programming as vehicles for the delivery of a flexible, context-appropriate response. Partners will focus on hard-to-reach areas which are at risk of remaining underserved as access and bureaucratic impediments continue to restrict aid delivery.  As part of a complementary and sequenced OCHA Pooled Fund response, this allocation will build on an additional $7 million reprogrammed towards the earthquake response through the MHF’s first Standard Allocation ($20 million) and other flexibility measures, including the activation of contingency budget lines and cost extensions for ongoing projects. The allocation has also been developed to complement the ongoing $5 million CERF Rapid Response allocation and the forthcoming second round of CERF support, increasing the scale and depth of aid delivered through these HC-managed funding mechanisms.  In line with the HC’s Vision Paper for the Fund, this allocation will support quality programming through earmarked support for AAP, disability inclusion, EORE and PSEA to promote a more inclusive and safe response. Beyond its immediate life-saving impact, the delivery of critical support, including multi-purpose cash, will help increase the resilience of affected people to cope with the compounding impacts of ongoing conflict and the additional threat posed by the looming monsoon season.",Reserve,5000000,4/15/2025 12:00:00 AM,4/30/2025 12:00:00 AM,,59,Myanmar,2025,Myanmar Original Humanitarian Needs and Response P##2025,4/30/2025 12:00:00 AM,0,0,5,4947590,1429,1,1
2025 First Standard Allocation,"This allocation aims to scale-up the delivery of prioritized life-saving humanitarian assistance to crisis-affected people with severe needs in hard-to-reach and underserved areas affected by escalating conflict and recurrent climate shocks. The strategic timing of this allocation will help kick-start aid delivery and resource mobilization efforts against the 2025 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan (HNRP). The timing of this allocation will also be critical in supporting resilience-building efforts in communities affected by the countrywide floods in 2024, which remain disproportionately exposed to the compounding impacts of enduring conflict and new climate shocks during the 2025 monsoon season (May-October).     This allocation builds on the joint CERF-MHF strategy development and prioritization process which was rolled out for the 2024 CERF Underfunded Emergencies (UFE) window (Round 2), expanding the collective reach and impact of HC-managed pooled funds by covering additional geographical locations and sectoral activities. This includes expanding geographical coverage into underserved conflict areas with extreme or catastrophic levels of intersectoral needs severity according to the 2025 HNRP, such as Kachin and Rakhine, and prioritizing much-needed funding for chronically under-resourced clusters as well as livelihood and resilience-building interventions.    Through the Flexible Localization Envelope (FLEX), this allocation will earmark US$7 million for local partners with limited experience managing international humanitarian grants, including new MHF partners onboarded in 2024, adding value by facilitating access to funding for local organizations. Additionally, this allocation will bolster cash coordination efforts across the response by promoting Multi-Purpose Cash Assistance (MPCA) following its introduction as a stand-alone section in the 2025 HNRP. In line with the MHF’s commitment to quality programming, this allocation will also support the mainstreaming of critical protection interventions, including prevention and response to sexual exploitation and abuse and gender-based violence as well as disability inclusion and explosive ordnance risk education.

2025 Second Standard Allocation,"Under its third allocation of 2025, the MHF will allocate $11 million in support of the Humanitarian Reset in Myanmar. Flexible funding will be made available through a competitive submission process to NGOs delivering timely, multi-sectoral humanitarian response. As needs show no signs of abating in 2026 and the funding landscape remains constrained, funding will be strategically prioritized through devolved operational decision-making processes to deliver impact in support of those most in need in Myanmar.  Direct support for local partners and equitable partnerships form the backbone of the strategy. Funding will be earmarked for grassroots local organizations, including newly eligible and previously unfunded local partners, through the Flexible Localization Envelope (FLEX) ($3.5 million), with an overall target of 50 per cent of total funding available ($5.5 million) direct to local partners (general and FLEX envelopes). Where funding international NGOs, transparency, resource sharing, capacity support, safety and security of local actors and strong oversight and monitoring will be prioritized.   The allocation approach is strategically aligned with the priorities of the 2026 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan (HNRP) incentivizing response in hard-to-reach areas of Myanmar with highest severity and unmet needs. MHF’s inclusive consultation processes ensure collectively agreed, locally led response approaches and decentralized decision-making on the use of increasingly limited resources.   This allocation will also support a more inclusive, accountable and innovative response in supporting partners to submit projects mainstreaming critical protection and cross-cutting approaches, including AAP, disability inclusion, EORE, gender and PSEA. Up to $1 million will be available for dedicated submissions from local partners demonstrating innovative  approaches in priority cross-cutting areas in line with system-wide initiatives promoted by the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) and Inter-Cluster Coordination Group (ICCG).

2nd Reserve Allocation,"Mozambique is ranked 28 out of 46 least-developed countries globally. The development situation has been compounded by multiple lingering and emerging humanitarian crises across the country for several years. The Northern province in Mozambique known as Cabo Delgado is the poorest and  has experienced an armed insurgency against State targets and civilians since 2017. The convergence of severe and escalating crises – conflict, climate shocks, and a deteriorating socio-economic situation further compounded the humanitarian situation in the province.   In its 2023 SEA Risk Assessment, the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) revealed significant gaps in prevention, reporting, and accountability mechanisms, particularly among local and national NGOs. The global funding suspension further threatens capacity-building efforts for national organizations, which are most in need of support to establish robust SEA investigative frameworks. In its efforts to bridge this gap, UNOCHA has approached UNOPS to support the implementation of the project Building Safe and Accountable Operations: Strengthening the Security and PSEA capacities. The overall objective of the UNOPS project is to enhance the operational security of partners working in the highly complex and volatile districts of Macomia and Quissanga in Cabo Delgado, where elevated security risks threaten the continuity of humanitarian operations and the safety of the aid workers.

The urgency of this allocation stems from the serious security incidents at Gaza's crossings, which have severely impacted the existing United Nations fleet and logistics capabilities. This has created a pressing need for immediate resource injection through the Reserve Allocation modality, a decision influenced by the compromised capacity to distribute vital aid effectively within the Gaza Strip.  This allocation aims to significantly enhance the logistical framework by procuring additional trucks urgently. This reinforcement is a response to immediate operational challenges and a strategic move to alleviate concerns regarding the UN system's capacity to manage increased aid flow into Gaza.

Fourth Reserve Allocation 2025,"The Fourth Reserve Allocation in 2025 is being launched at a moment of profound crisis. Gaza continues to face large-scale destruction, displacement, and the breakdown of essential services, while the recent ceasefire provides only partial and uncertain relief. In the West Bank, escalating protection risks, movement restrictions, and declining humanitarian access have deepened vulnerabilities across affected communities. Field reporting and inter-cluster assessments point to widening service gaps that require a targeted and realistic funding approach.     Given the scale of needs and the limited HF envelope, the allocation adopts a focused strategy. Rather than dispersing resources across all clusters, the Fund concentrates support where it can enable measurable change and where partners can deliver under current operational conditions. This avoids the pattern of small, symbolic contributions that do not meaningfully alter outcomes, and instead channels funding toward clusters where HF resources are capable of strengthening services, filling critical gaps, or restoring essential functions.

Reserve allocation 4,"South Sudan continues to face overlapping crises, including floods, conflict, and food insecurity – all of which continue to negatively impact the resilience and vulnerability of people across the country. Approximately 6.6 million people, or over half of South Sudan’s population (54%), risk experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity, classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse between October and November 2022. Of those, 2.2 million people are experiencing worse conditions in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) acute food insecurity, and an estimated 61,000 people in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) acute food insecurity in Fangak, Canal/Pigi and Akobo of Jonglei State; Pibor County in the Greater Pibor Administrative Area. The most food insecure states between October and November 2022, where more than 50% of their populations are facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse acute food insecurity, are Jonglei (68%), Unity (66%), Northern Bahr el Ghazal (62%), Upper Nile (58%), Warrap (57%), and Lakes (57%).     According to the April Needs Analysis Working Group classification, the severity of the inter-sectoral need is the highest in the 5 IPC, 4 counties where the October 2022 IPC analysis projected some pockets of IPC5 during the 2023 lean season (Akobo, Fangak, Canal/Pigi, Leer and Mayendit), while in Kapoeta East, three years of severe drought have wiped out the crops on which the population's food security depends. The multifaceted effects of the crises contribute to persisting high levels of malnutrition that remain above the emergency threshold of 15 per cent (very high acute malnutrition level- WHO classification) at 16.0% (15.4 -16.7) in a lean season starting in 2019. High food insecurity, lack of hygiene, health, environmental sanitation services, and inadequate maternal and child carer are the main drivers of malnutrition in South Sudan. Staggering 31 counties in four states (Jonglei, Unity, Warrap, and Upper Nile) have Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) prevalence above the emergency threshold of 15 per cent. Food insecurity is high in Canal/Pigi, Fangak, Akobo, Mayendit, Leer, and Kapoeta East, with all falling under IPC phase 4 for acute food insecurity, posing a risk of worsening the nutrition situation unless urgent actions are undertaken.      When food insecurity arises, women and children are the most at risk of malnutrition, hunger, and associated rights violations, as no crisis is gender and age neutral. The complex challenges contributing to the famine situation amplifies GBV risks for women and girls, particularly those already vulnerable to violence. Income insecurity, often combined with exponential increases in the cost of basic commodities, sparks and heightens violence, particularly intimate partner violence, sexual violence, exploitation, and abuse, leading families to adopt negative coping strategies such as child and forced marriage. The impact of hunger, reduced incomes, and the skyrocketing cost of living create immense stress on households, and devastatingly, women and girls bear the brunt.    Given the high levels of severe acute food insecurity in South Sudan, there is a need for immediate scale-up of multi-sectoral humanitarian assistance to save lives and prevent the total collapse of livelihoods in the affected counties, particularly those with a high share of populations in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) acute food insecurity.

This has caused a reduction in flooded areas used for agriculture, and a lowering of groundwater table. This is expected to result in reduced agricultural outputs and reduced access to drinking water, which will affect the population directly and indirectly due to lack of fodder and drinking water for livestock. As a result, food insecurity is expected to increase and livelihoods are at risk. The allocation of $3.9 million is targeting interventions that will anticipate these impacts and have as objective to reduce the impact on the population. The interventions focus on livelihood activities, in particular keeping livestock alive, WASH interventions (access to water) and to a lesser extend nutrition activities to address the undernourishment that is already apparent.",Reserve,3900000,12/6/2021 12:00:00 AM,12/28/2021 12:00:00 AM,End of year allocations _Sudan HF.pdf##237248##Allocation Type##https://onegms.unocha.org/pubdocs/Allocationsdocs/SUD-AllocDocs_2021_378_455.pdf##,15,Sudan,2021,Sudan Humanitarian Response Plan 2021##2021,12/28/2021 12:00:00 AM,0,0,5,5471313,378,1,1

The allocations to Kindrig camp, West Darfur ($0.7 million) and Sortony, North Darfur ($1.72 million) will allow for secondary displaced people to return to their IDP camps. Kindrig camp was affected by heavy intercommunal violence in January 2021, while Sortony camp was the center of fighting between government forces and non-state armed actors. The allocation to Melloi in East Darfur ($0.4 million) provides support to a small group of IDP’s and their host communities that have hosted them for over a year, since they were displaced from the neighboring state of South Darfur after intercommunal violence.

In recent year, these areas witnessed armed conflict between government forces and armed non-state actors. Cut-off from the Sudan humanitarian architecture and from basic services provided by the government during the armed conflict, critical needs in education, health, WASH, protection and food security emerged but could not be properly addressed.

2021- Reserve for Emergencies (Multi-Sector Needs Assessment),"The MSNA proposed and led by IOM (under the CCS sector) would address urgent information gaps on humanitarian needs and vulnerabilities, providing a robust evidence-based analysis of needs and severity during the HNO and HRP processes in Sudan.

IOM’s capacity, position as the lead agency for displacement data in Sudan and experience in the 2020 MSNA, coupled with the SHF’s potential funding support (estimated at 1,000,000 USD), would ensure the timely implementation of this critical MSNA for 2021 – and its resulting benefit for humanitarian response planning and programming across all sectors going forward.

2022 - SHF Reserve for Emergencies (End of year allocation- Hard to Reach Areas in Sudan),"This allocation targets the hard-to-reach areas in Sudan, which have an acute lack of basic services, across all sectors, and which have seen very little humanitarian assistance over the last decade.   Since two years, when the areas became accessible again, SHF has allocated substantial amounts. It is continuing its engagement through this allocation, now that operations funded through last year’s allocation is running to its end. Furthermore, in the identified areas in Central and South Darfur, as well as in the south of the country, tensions between the parties in the protracted conflicts are on the increase. This allocation will allow timely services to address the most basic needs before access might be too constraint. Likewise, if the protracted conflicts escalate in the coming months, much needed funds and operational partners will be readily available.    Due to the limited numbers of partners that can operate in the area, the allocation uses  the reserve modality, with programming done through a consultative area-based approach with clusters and operational partners together. One third of the allocation covers protection services, health and nutrition receive each a quarter, and smaller amounts are allocated to nutrition, education, livelihood and shelter services.

2022 - SHF response to intercommunal violence across Sudan,"Over the first half of 2022, intercommunal violence erupted in several locations in West Darfur, causing displacement of people inside West Darfur and to North Darfur and an overall operational insecure environment. The situation calmed down in June-July allowing needs assessments to take place. Intercommunal violence erupted as well in Blue Nile state, causing displacement inside the state and to Sennar. This allocation of $4.5 million targets the displaced people of these conflicts and covers seven sectors, with the WASH sector being the largest (33%) and a quarter going towards protection and education in emergencies. Nine partners, of which three national NGO’s will provide first-line emergency response to address the urgent needs in Blue Nile and Sennar, as well as remaining gaps in essential services in West Darfur and North Darfur. With this allocation, among others, sanitation services will be provided in the overcrowded IDP camps in Geneina town, West Darfur, during the rainy season, temporary learning spaces and child-friendly spaces provided for IDP’s in North Darfur and  children under five will be treated for malnourishment in Sennar and Blue Nile.

2022- SHF Reserve for Emergencies  (Sub-national Conflict/Dry-Spell),"This allocation responds to the urgent needs stemming from the deteriorating security and food security due to conflict and dry spell in West Darfur. Intercommunal violence has flared up considerably since November 2021, in Jebel Moon, Sirba and Kreneik localities. The failed 2021 rainy season has put considerable pressure on the agricultural and water resources, and compounds the economic crisis due to high inflation, all in a context of inter-communal tensions and a tense political situation in Sudan. The Arab nomads’ perceptions that their communities are discriminated and marginalized from humanitarian assistance is driving tensions among communities, requiring that humanitarian response is conflict sensitive by being inclusive of the vulnerable among IDPs, host residents and nomads.  The humanitarian response has to continue to respond to the over 100,000 IDP’s who still remain gathering sites in Geneina, displaced since the violent attacks on the Krindig and Abuzar camps and Al Jebel Area in January and April 2021.    This case for funding seeks to directly address the consequences of the failed rain seasons and harvest failure through nutrition, WASH, and livelihood activities in Foro Baranga, Kreneik, Sirba and Jebel Moon.      The allocation of $3.98 million (of which $1.3 million for dry-spell response) will provide a critical injection of resources to livelihoods, WASH, health, nutrition, S/NFI, child protection and GBV interventions in Kreneik, Kulbus, Jebel Moon, Sirba and Foro Baranga localities.

Stabilization centres report considerably higher admissions of severe acute malnutrition and require urgent humanitarian support to be able to continue and increase their critical services till the end of the lean season.   In Sudan, 115 localities in 14 states have been identified as the most affected by the dry spells and crop failure. In these localities, 79 stabilization centers (SCs) are functional with only 34 centers supported by humanitarian partners and remaining 45 are not supported. As such, all the 79 stabilization centers in 115 of the most affected localities will continue to provide minimum services till the end of the year.

2022- SHF Reserve for Emergencies (Drought Response),"The failing economy, prolonged dry spells and erratic rainfall in the 2021 rainy season have resulted in shortages and high cost of agricultural inputs and labor, reduced harvests and a decrease in cultivated area. Further, the crop production in the 2021 cropping season was impacted by economical inflation, diseases, and pest infestation. This significantly reduced crop and livestock production up to 50 percent in 14 states across Sudan. Also, the below-average rainy seasons have caused a shortage of water for domestic use and livestock, impacting livelihoods and access to drinking water. The prolonged dry spell and subsequent crop failure are expected to exacerbate humanitarian needs and increased the risk of conflict due to the early migration of pastoral communities. Urgent and multi-sector lifesaving services are needed to prevent further deterioration of the humanitarian situation.    At the end of 2021, SHF already allocated $3.6 million in the response to the impact of these dry spells on WASH and nutrition needs and on people’s livelihoods, in Kassala, North Kordofan and North Darfur states. In addition, a West Darfur allocation in 2022 includes a $1.3 million dry spell component. The 2022 dry spell allocation, includes responses to Red Sea, South Darfur, East Darfur, Central Darfur and Gedaref, for an amount of $6.2 million, bringing the SHF’s total response to $11.1 million in the 9 most affected states. The projects target WASH, nutrition and livelihood sectors, with activities ranging from provision of fodder, urgent veterinary services, distribution of drought resistant seeds, emergency water supply, rehabilitation of shallow wells and animal water points and distribution of supplementary food supplies and plumpy nuts.

The Sudan Humanitarian Fund (SHF) has allocated its second reserve funding this year in response to this crisis, with a focus now on addressing the cholera outbreak and meeting the needs in hard-to-reach areas.  This allocation will enable health actors to sustain their cholera response, which was at risk of suspension due to insufficient funding, for the next three months. Furthermore, while the initial allocation in 2023 primarily addressed the needs in more accessible regions, this current allocation places significant emphasis on the hard-to-reach areas, which are still experiencing active conflict.

2023 - SHF Reserve for Emergencies (Prepositioning of Stock),"In 2022, over 418,000 people were internally displaced due to localised violence, floods and other emergencies. Additionally, Sudan continues to welcome refugees – mainly from South Sudan, Eritrea and Ethiopia. These elements are likely to remain in 2023. Inter-communal conflict has already been experienced in several locations in 2023 resulting in causalities, destruction of property and displacements.  The immediate and most urgent needs of displaced people are generally centered around shelter, items to cook and access to water and health services. The prepositioning of items, such as plastic sheets for shelter, mosquito nets, jerry cans and cooking sets are essential to quickly respond to the needs of the affected population.   This allocation will allow UNHCR to procure 11,500 NFI kits for rapid distribution to partners responding to these sudden onset emergencies, covering the needs of almost 60,000 people. Together with UNHCR’s other funding streams that maybe allocated to prepositioning of stock (additional 13,500 NFI kits based on 2022 figures) and other actors prepositioning NFI items, the allocation will cover the needs of a large part of the displaced people expected in 2023. The allocation is in time to procure and preposition the items before the flood season (July-September).

2024 - SHF Reserve for Emergencies (Lifesaving response to displacement and famine in Sudan),"Within the ongoing broader crisis in Sudan, specific humanitarian needs continue to emerge. In the past month, additional humanitarian needs arose in Sennar and El Fasher due to shifting conflict lines and further displacement is very likely in other areas. Also, deportees are arriving back to Sudan in increasing numbers and many IDPs are moving to areas contaminated by explosive ordnances. The food crisis is also expected to worsen beyond the lean season as agricultural activities will likely be curtailed due to the conflict. Therefore, a timely area-based allocation, which allows lifesaving services to start up once the rainy season ends in September 2024, is vital to reach the people in famine hot-spots, in active conflict areas, as well as to reach the recently displaced people and deportees.  SHF is launching an area-based allocation, programmed by actors on the ground. The Allocation prioritizes areas at risk of famine, which have faced or are likely to face further conflict and displacement, contaminated with explosive ordnances where IDPs move to and entry points for deportees. The response, programmed through decentralized consultation meetings and engagements with communities, will address the most urgent humanitarian needs specific to the localities most in need, targeting over 250,000 people who find themselves in life threatening situations.",Reserve,4E+07,7/31/2024 12:00:00 AM,10/31/2024 12:00:00 AM,IDP and famine allocation Sudan 7th Reserve allocation_FINAL..pdf##410428##Allocation Type##https://onegms.unocha.org/pubdocs/Allocationsdocs/SUD-AllocDocs_2024_1300_1116.pdf##,15,Sudan,2024,Sudan Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan 2024##2024,10/31/2024 12:00:00 AM,0,0,28,4.40992E+07,1300,1,1

2024 - SHF Reserve for Emergencies (Prepositioning of Stock),"The ongoing conflict in Sudan since April 2023 has created an unprecedented large-scale forced displacement of more than 10 million people, many of whom have been displaced multiple times. In June 2024, displacement figures increased substantially again as the conflict reached El Fasher in North Darfur and Sennar States. These displacements are taking place when the country is at the brink of famine with almost 800,000 people at-risk, annual floods are expected to be more severe than previous years and the socio-economic situation in the country has further deteriorated, making it increasingly difficult for people to purchase basic commodities and items needed for survival.  The distribution of non-food items such as kitchen utensils, mosquito nets and jerry cans are essential to quickly respond to the needs of newly and multiply displaced people. Such assistance is vital especially during a food crisis, when food and water contamination and an increase in water- or vector-borne diseases like malaria can become deadly for the a population whose health status has been severely weakened by over one year of conflict. With this allocation, UNHCR will distribute up to 12,000 NFI kits to newly or multiply displaced households to prevent further catastrophe in the displacement locations.",Reserve,2000000,7/1/2024 12:00:00 AM,7/15/2024 12:00:00 AM,,15,Sudan,2024,Sudan Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan 2024##2024,7/15/2024 12:00:00 AM,0,0,1,2000000,1286,1,1

Recent reports from UNOCHA and IOM indicate severe disruptions in basic services, especially healthcare, with escalating vulnerabilities due to food insecurity, displacement, and a strained healthcare infrastructure. The health system is at risk of collapsing without immediate support. This makes it critical to allocate resources now through the CBPF Reserve Allocation to prevent a complete breakdown in healthcare services in Al Managil.  The presence of a cholera outbreak, along with increased risks of other outbreaks due to flooding, inadequate WASH services, and limited vaccination efforts, highlights the urgency to strengthen emergency preparedness and response. This allocation will not only help maintain essential healthcare services but also enhance the capacity to respond to emerging public health crises.

2024 - SHF Reserve for Emergencies (SHF 48h response [Rapid funding to newly emerging humanitarian needs in the wider Sudan humanitarian crisis] ),"The humanitarian situation in Sudan is dire, marked by widespread conflict, displacement, and food insecurity. Ongoing violence, particularly in Darfur and the Kordofan states, has now displaced over 10 million people, leaving many without access to basic necessities such as food, water, and shelter, including at least 1.8 million women and girls in need of reproductive health services. The economic crisis exacerbates the situation, leading to soaring inflation and scarce resources. Health services are overwhelmed, and malnutrition rates are alarmingly high, especially among children.  Within this broader crisis, specific humanitarian needs continue to emerge suddenly. For example, in the past month, additional humanitarian needs arose in Sennar and El Fasher due to shifting conflict lines. Access issues make forward planning of service provision challenging, leading to sudden funding needs.  In this context, a rapid response mechanism like the 48-hour response is an essential tool for the SHF to effectively address urgent needs. The 2023 pilot of the 48-hour response grants has been widely acclaimed by stakeholders for enabling humanitarian partners to respond to sudden needs or new operational opportunities within days.

Malnutrition rates are rising, and essential protection and health services remain critically under-resourced.    The situation is especially volatile in Darfur and the Kordofan states, where access constraints and active hostilities make traditional humanitarian delivery difficult. In North Darfur alone, over 100,000 people were recently displaced from El Fasher  following the RSF’s capture of the city, underscoring the speed and scale at which new emergencies are unfolding.    In this context, SHF is urgently allocating $12 million to reinforce grassroots-led action under the MAG mechanism.

2025 - SHF Reserve Allocation (Anticipatory cholera response in high-risk states ahead of the 2025 rainy season),"Sudan has experienced consecutive cholera outbreaks in 2023 and 2024, pointing to an emerging pattern of endemic transmission. The current wave, declared in August 2024, has already resulted in over 57,000 suspected cases and 1,534 deaths by March 2025. Critically, the outbreak has persisted through the dry season — with White Nile, Gedaref, Aj Jazirah, and Kassala among the hardest hit — indicating elevated baseline risk and the strong likelihood of further spread with the onset of rains.  This $5 million Reserve Allocation enables anticipatory, high-impact intervention in four of the most affected states over the past two years. Informed by the 2025 Cholera Response Plan, the allocation prioritizes urgent supplies for diagnostics and case management, strengthens surveillance and coordination, boosts infection control in health facilities and communities, and supports life-saving WASH and risk communication activities. Targeted localities were selected based on recent outbreak trends and the presence of operational partners.  The strategic value of this allocation lies in its speed, precision, and forward-looking posture. By acting ahead of the rainy season, it enables partners to contain transmission risks before they escalate.

2025 - SHF Reserve Allocation (Emergency Shelter Response to displacements from ZamZam camp),"On 11 April, RSF forces attacked Zamzam camp, killing over 400 civilians—including 12 medical workers from Relief International—and forcibly taking control of the site. According to IOM, about 80,000 households were displaced, many fleeing toward El Fasher and Tawila. With El Fasher largely inaccessible, the IDP influx into Tawila is growing rapidly as well as in Jebel Marra. New arrivals are sheltering in open spaces without basic household items or protection from the elements.  While health, water, and sanitation services are under strain, they are partially supported by the latest SHF 48-hour allocation and ongoing projects. However, emergency shelter and NFI support remains a critical gap. Local markets are unable to meet demand, and planned MPCA distributions will only partially help. SHF partners report urgent needs for direct in-kind assistance.  This Reserve Allocation will provide emergency shelter and NFIs for 13,000 households ahead of the rainy season. It builds on active frontline engagement by ERRs and NGOs and fills a life-threatening gap in the response. The timing is critical: no other funding is currently available to meet these immediate needs, and standard allocation timelines would arrive too late. The allocation reinforces SHF’s role in enabling fast, field-anchored, and lifesaving response.    Solidarites International (SI), the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) have been identified as the most pertinent partners to deliver this response.

2025 - SHF Reserve Allocation (Enabling Safe Civilian Return and Humanitarian Access Through Emergency Mine Action in Conflict-Affected areas - Sudan),"This SHF Reserve Allocation of USD 4 million responds to a critical window of opportunity created by recent shifts in territorial control. Following the Sudanese Armed Forces’ recapture of key areas, including Khartoum in March 2025, spontaneous and organized returns are accelerating into urban zones heavily contaminated by explosive ordnance (EO). These hazards now block safe civilian return, endanger aid workers, and obstruct access to infrastructure such as roads, hospitals, and schools. Without urgent action, growing population movements will outpace the operational capacity to manage these life-threatening risks.  This allocation builds on two earlier CERF-funded phases: one that pre-positioned mine action equipment (Nov 2024), and one that launched initial survey and clearance operations (Mar 2025). The SHF now enables a full-scale deployment: eight multi-task and two clearance teams will clear EO from priority infrastructure; four mobile “EORE Plus” teams will deliver risk education and map hazardous areas; victim assistance activities will identify and support EO survivors; and targeted training—including for female deminers—will strengthen national surge capacity.

2025 - SHF Reserve Allocation (Sustaining Conflict Response and Stabilising Cholera Interventions in the South of Sudan),"Communities in Sudan’s southern border areas are facing a rapidly escalating humanitarian crisis. The compounding effects of conflict, mass displacement, a growing cholera outbreak, and a sharp decline in funding have pushed an already fragile situation to the brink. Since April 2023, an estimated 1.88 million internally displaced persons have arrived in areas that originally hosted 2.15 million people—placing extraordinary strain on overstretched health, WASH, and protection systems.  This $7 million Reserve Allocation from the Sudan Humanitarian Fund comes at a critical time. The lean season is intensifying food insecurity and disease risks, while humanitarian access remains constrained. A recent cholera outbreak has exposed major gaps in health and WASH infrastructure, with local capacity further weakened by the withdrawal of major funding sources since January 2025.  This allocation prioritizes life-saving support through multi-purpose cash assistance (MPCA), health, WASH, and protection interventions, reaching vulnerable populations in hard-to-access, underserved areas. It supports integrated, community-driven approaches that allow for swift scale-up of existing activities and reinforce local response capacity. Through timely and targeted disbursement, the SHF strengthens its role in safeguarding humanitarian space, sustaining minimum service delivery, and preventing further deterioration in an increasingly fragile operating environment.",Reserve,7000000,7/10/2025 12:00:00 AM,7/22/2025 12:00:00 AM,6th Reserve Allocation - border regions final.pdf##349997##Allocation Type##https://onegms.unocha.org/pubdocs/Allocationsdocs/SUD-AllocDocs_2025_1461_1441.pdf##,15,Sudan,2025,Sudan Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan 2025##2025,7/22/2025 12:00:00 AM,0,0,7,6994662,1461,1,1

2025 - SHF Standard Allocation (Allocation to the most underfunded localities),"The Sudan Humanitarian Fund (SHF) is launching this US$ 33 million allocation at a critical juncture marked by escalating conflict, mass displacement, recurrent disease outbreaks, and large-scale spontaneous returns. Since April 2023, Sudan has become one of the world’s largest displacement crises, with more than 13 million people uprooted. Recent spikes in displacement from El Fasher and the increased intensity of conflict in the Darfurs and Kordofans underscore the urgency of action.    From the 17 priority localities endorsed by the HCT, identified by the ICCG as having the highest convergence of displacement, food insecurity, protection risks, and operational feasibility, the SHF selected 9 localities for this allocation. This refinement was based on a comparative review of existing funding streams, including the most recent SHF area-based allocation and the ongoing $20 million CERF Rapid Response allocation. Localities that had already received substantial support through either mechanism were deprioritized, while those with acute needs but limited coverage were elevated for inclusion. As a result, the selected 9 localities represent the areas where gaps were most pronounced. The final selection ensures that SHF funding fills the most critical shortfalls, strengthens operational continuity, and maximizes the combined impact of SHF and CERF interventions across the Darfurs, Kordofans, Khartoum, and Al Gezirah.

"2025-Lifesaving NFI, WASH, and Logistics Support in Response to Displacement in and from conflict-affected zones in Sudan","The recent escalation of conflict in Al Fasher has triggered large-scale displacement, creating an urgent need for immediate humanitarian support. Almost 100,000 people fled between 26 October and 13 November with little or no belongings, leaving them exposed to harsh conditions without adequate shelter or basic relief items. This sudden surge in needs cannot wait for the longer timelines of a standard allocation, making the Reserve Allocation modality essential to ensure a rapid response.    The USD 2,000,000 allocation to IOM will enable swift transport of existing stocks and in-kind support from other funding sources through cross-line and cross-border deliveries to Common Pipeline partners in the Darfur and Kordofan regions, as well as any other emerging conflict-affected displacement locations, ensuring items reach those in need in the shortest possible time, while also allowing IOM to replenish depleted stocks to respond to this and other crises across Sudan.

3rd Reserve Allocation 2019,"In order to prioritize and guide the response to the new situation, OCHA is working with all relevant partners to finalize a concise ‘Emergency Response Plan’ that analyzes the critical needs and gaps in the response and identifies priority activities, within the existing Humanitarian Response Plan, for meeting these needs in the short term.   The present allocation is aimed at supporting the ongoing response from within Syria, as an integral part of that plan, in close coordination with actors using all modalities of assistance. The allocation aims to support those humanitarian partners within Syria with the capacity and access to make the greatest difference for the most vulnerable people, as quickly as possible.     The allocation is guided by the strategic direction set by the Humanitarian Country Team, which has identified the following key priorities, inter alia, to guide the humanitarian response:    1.	Assisting the newly displaced, particularly those in collective shelters and residing with host community members;  2.	Maintaining support in existing IDP camps, sites and settlements, as well as in host communities (1.8 million people in need in the NES, including 1 3 million people in SDF-held areas)  3.	Maintaining crossline missions. These have so far included the 14 families 84 individuals evacuated from Mabruka camp on 24 October, and the ongoing work to repair and maintain the Alouk water station. Planning is underway for an inter-agency assessment and convoy to Ein Issa and to assess the significant number of returns taking place in Operation Peace Spring areas, particularly Tal Abiad and Suluk sub districts in Ar Raqqa.  4.	Ensuring minimum continuity of services to populations living in areas shifting control and/or who are currently being assisted through cross-border modalities, including in situations where that assistance may be disrupted by changing security and administrative dynamics.     In accordance with the above priorities, the allocation is designed to support projects implemented via two distinct modalities: regular programming and cross-line interagency missions in NES.     Regular programming activities will be focused on the delivery of critical services including Health, WASH, Shelter, Food and Agriculture and Protection, in affected areas that accessible by partners working from within Syria in NES. The geographic focus of regular programming activities will depend on the evolution of needs in the coming weeks and the continuity of service provision in collective shelters.  Should current patterns of return and service provision continue, it is likely the greatest added value will be in focusing the allocation on supporting response in camps and affected communities, rather than in collective shelters.     Inter-agency missions will complement this regular program support, and will provide critical assistance to areas that are more difficult to access via regular programs. They will be focused in an initial phase on Tabqa and Ein Issa in Ar Raqqa governorate, and subsequently will aim to expand to Menbij and Ein Al-Arab in Aleppo governorate. On 29 October 2019, the United Nations received approval from the Government of Syria to conduct cross-line interagency missions areas in Ar Raqqa and Aleppo. The UN will continue to engage at high levels to advocate for an expansion of inter-agency missions wherever feasible. The inter-agency missions will include both needs assessment to inform planning as well as provision of assistance and protection services.

3rd Reserve Allocation to Support UNHAS,"The Reserve Allocation aims to ensure continuation of the United Nations Humanitarian Air Services (UNHAS)   in Syria. The amount of up to US $1 million has been made available to ensure the continuity of humanitarian   air services, including for medical evacuations, enabling timely, coordinated and efficient delivery of aid to   most affected communities.  BACKGROUND  • UNHAS started operating in 2020 in Syria to ensure safe, reliable and sustainable air access to beneficiaries   for the humanitarian community mainly in those parts of Syria that are not easily accessible by road. UNHAS   Syria monthly operational expenditure is US $450,000. In 2021, donor contributions to its operations in  Syria amounted to US $5.5 million from eight donors. UNHAS facilitated efficient and timely delivery of   assistance to North-East Syria and Aleppo. Additionally, UNHAS is exploring ways to operate to Deir-ez-Zor.   A monthly average of 350 humanitarian workers uses UNHAS services - from primarily Red Cross,   international and national NGOs and UN agencies. UNHAS ships humanitarian cargo as well with monthly   average of 3.16 million tons (MT). Moreover, UNHAS provides the required capacity for medical and   emergency evacuation.   • UNHAS is a critical enabler for the Sustainable Development Goals as it facilitates humanitarian access and   provides an effective humanitarian response during times of emergency. Since January 2021, UNHAS has   carried some 2,609 passengers supporting the response and access for the humanitarian community   operating inside Syria. UNHAS is currently available to 36 organizations whose work spans across the Food   Security, Nutrition, Health, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) sectors with passenger and light cargo   transport. UNHAS also provided critical medical and security evacuation services for humanitarian staff.   • The humanitarian cost of the disruption of UNHAS services, even if only temporary, is 3.5 million people in   need in Al-Hasakeh and Aleppo being put at risk of not receiving essential humanitarian assistance.   Moreover, the opportunity for air operations in Deir-ez-Zor may be lost. UNHAS conducted the technical   assessment for Deir-ez-Zor in October 2021 and the request to obtain approval to operate to Deir-ez-Zor   was submitted to authorities on 16 November 2021. Finally, the logistical impediments if UNHAS stops its   air transportation services are significant. If the service exits the country due to a lack of funding, it will take   World Food Programme (WFP) about seven months to continue operations if allowed by local authorities   to do so. WFP anticipates bilateral funding to be received by mid-March 2022 and has identified a critical   gap period between mid-January to mid-March 2022.

4th Reserve Allocation for Support to Medical Supplies - WHO,"The Reserve Allocation aims to address acute emergency needs in health facilities through procurement of   life-saving medicines and vital medical supplies including ventilators, equipping COVID-19 case   management centers and strengthening diagnostic capacity of national laboratories. An amount of US $3   million has been made available for this allocation to ensure immediate needs are met in complementarity  with other funding sources that WHO is exploring.  BACKGROUND  • Acute shortages of life-saving medicines across all public health facilities in Syria, especially related   to hospitalized patients’ case management, are observed1  . This is due to the ongoing COVID-19   pandemic, and its recent (highest and longest) 4th wave that continues devastating health sector   capacity to respond. Currently, the national stock for medicines in public warehouses stands low at   alarming level - only 20 per cent of the needs for 2022 are available2  , including six per cent of certain   types of anticoagulants (blood thinners) and anaesthetic medicines where other specific antibiotics   and IV fluids are available.   • Due to the extreme limited vaccine coverage (as of 7 December 2021, only around five per cent of   the population vaccinated in government-controlled areas and North-East Syria (NES) due to delays   in vaccines supplies), some 95 per cent of the population are at risk of infection, of which at least 20   per cent are likely to be at risk of hospitalization in the upcoming COVID-19 surges3  .

Saving lives through averting further deterioration of the nutritional situation and strengthening resilience of the most critically affected people,"The prioritization for this allocation builds on the priority needs expressed in the recent Multi-sector Needs Assessment, and the 2022-2023 Syria Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP). The prioritization for this allocation was also informed by the outcomes of extensive consultations with the humanitarian community and analysis of other funding flows to Syria. To bridge some of the identified critical gaps in response, this allocation prioritizes a multi-sectoral response to the deteriorating nutrition situation, and strengthening the resilience of vulnerable people in areas with high severity needs and poor response reach.    Within its first priority, the allocation will support the strengthening of a comprehensive multi-sector nutrition response through joint nutrition, food security, health, WASH, and Protection interventions.  Considering the high number of malnourished children under five years of age and pregnant and lactating women (5.5 million), and the continuing drastic deterioration of the nutrition situation in Syria; this allocation will focus on supporting the provision of specialized treatment and management of malnutrition cases and averting the anticipated further deterioration of the situation in areas with the highest severity needs and poor nutrition response reach. The allocation will have additional strategic added value by boosting the currently limited nutrition response capacity and strengthening multi-sector programming to enable the humanitarian system to address the needs and risks holistically.       Within its second priority, the allocation will contribute to strengthening the resilience of the most critically affected people in the areas with high needs and poor inter-sector response and reach. It will prioritize projects focusing on improving the protection environment, tailored food assistance to the vulnerable families, livelihood opportunities, and sustained access to critical basic services. This approach is in line with the 2022-2023 HRP priorities and will enable the humanitarian community to address some of the critical humanitarian needs more effectively, efficiently, and sustainably. Eleven years into the Syrian conflict, investing in resilience programming is critical to prevent a larger and more protracted crisis, and to ensure sustainability of humanitarian operations. The allocation will have a long-term added value countering the increasing needs with assistance that empowers people to meet their basic needs autonomously.      Within both priorities, the allocation will put specific emphasis on the SHF’s areas of effective programming, namely Accountability to Affected Populations, promoting the centrality of protection, preventing Gender-based Violence, and preventing Sexual Exploitation and Abuse as well as an area-based approach which responds to the whole population living in need in a specific geographic area by improving their overall living conditions.

First Standard Allocation 2025,"The allocation released by the Syria Cross-border Humanitarian Fund (SCHF) and Syria Humanitarian Fund (SHF) represents a strategic, unified response to the acute and evolving humanitarian needs across Syria. In the aftermath of the government dissolution in 2024 and amid persistent conflict, seventy percent Syrians require urgent assistance, with displacement, returns, and continued instability reshaping the humanitarian landscape. While the current Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) targets eight million people and is only than 11 percent funded, this allocation ensures resources are directed where they are most impactful.  The strategy targets displaced populations, vulnerable host communities, and returnees in areas facing the most severe needs, while including contingency planning to enable rapid, principled response to new or escalating emergencies. By prioritizing multi-sectoral, integrated intervention, the allocation’s primary goal is to both save lives and stimulate resilience, supporting sustainable transitions for affected communities.  Aligned with the one Syria  vision, this allocation advances the consolidation of a renewed pooled fund and contributes to a unified, inclusive, and coordinated humanitarian response structure.

Second Reserve Allocation 2025,"Al- Rastan Bridge on Homs-Hama M5 Highway is severely damaged during the war in December 2024. The bridge is a critical ‘node’ on north-south transport axis.   The severe damage of this installation is affecting delivery of humanitarian assistance as convoys have to undertake a detour of about 90 kms. Assistance to more than one third (5 million) of people who require assistance passes on this road. It is a major supply chain for the humanitarian response in Aleppo, Hama, Idleb and Coastal governorates of Tartus and Latakia.  In view of the above and in consideration of the primary objective of the emergency rehabilitation of the bridge, to facilitate humanitarian access and facilitate humanitarian operations, the HC has decided to release a total of US $ 2.5 million towards the rehabilitation of the Al-Rastan bridge.  The allocation for emergency rehabilitation of the bridge, is proposed to facilitate humanitarian access and facilitate humanitarian operations in Syria.

Third Reserve Allocation,"The abrupt freezing of US funding has forced 38 NGOs operating in Northeast Syria (NES) to halt operations, leaving 90 per cent of humanitarian activities in the region paralyzed. This funding shortage has caused massive disruptions in humanitarian programmes in NES including the provision of life-saving assistance to at least 2.5 million people, that include those in internally displaced people (IDP camps) as well as coordination efforts.  Protection services are among the most severely impacted alongside services and assistance pertaining to camp coordination and camp management (CCCM), health, shelter and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). Five camps have been identified as most affected and are facing severe disruptions in essential services including Al Hol, Roj, Washokani, Areesha, and Mahmouli.  The crisis is unfolding amid a humanitarian scale-up declaration for Syria and an ongoing review of coordination structures. Compounding the situation, the NES Forum, which has played a critical coordination role, will cease its operations by 6 March 2025, further jeopardizing response efforts.

2020 1st Reserve Allocation,"This emergency allocation will address the immediate needs as outlined below and, considering the very volatile environment, aims to be flexible in responding to the immediate and urgent needs on the ground for relocation, newly displaced persons and scale-up services in camps and overburdened host communities. Interventions will aim to scale up and complement the ongoing response, including ongoing reprogramming of existing interventions that have been affected or interrupted by the ongoing violence. This strategy has been developed based on the most recent figures and numbers and locations in the readiness and response plan and will be updated during proposals as the situation rapidly evolves.    As such, the allocation will align with the three objectives of the humanitarian readiness and response plan:  1.	Allocation Strategic Objective (ASO) 1: Protection of civilians  	Protection services: will be implemented through an emergency response model that relies on expanding the capacity of static service points (community centers, child-friendly spaces, and women and girls’ safe spaces) and mobile outreach teams. Due to the dynamic nature of the Syrian context, this approach supports affected populations with multiple entry points to protection services and allows cluster members to continue the delivery of services in rapidly-changing circumstances to respond to existing gaps and anticipated growing needs. Procurement and provision of dignity kits are also included;  	Safe Relocation: of people to save areas by provision of transportation services. This includes relocation support and facilitation of routes for people to move safely away from hostilities and to safe destinations.  2.	Allocation Strategic Objective (ASO) 2: Provision of safe reception centers and shelters in and out of camps   	CCCM and emergency shelter: Expansion of existing and establishment of new camps to increase emergency shelter capacity for the newly displaced IDPs, provision of camp management and coordination in the newly established and extended camps and provision of protection and mainstreamed multi-sectoral lifesaving assistance in these sites  and procurement of emergency shelter;   	WASH: Procurement and provision of critical Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) supplies and services to people in newly established and extended camp and out of camp locations  with priority to locations that are overwhelmed with new arrivals;  3.	Allocation Strategic Objective (ASO) 3: Provision of emergency services in and out of camps;  	Food assistance and livelihoods: Prepositioning and distributing of ready-to-eat-rations (RTER), food baskets, support to mobile kitchens and cooked meals to respond to the basic needs of newly displaced IDPs;    	Health: Procurement and provision of medical supplies, including trauma and surgical kits/supplies, anesthetics drugs and supplementary medicines, support to ambulance services, mobile clinics in IDPs sites and facilities in targeted locations that are overwhelmed with new arrivals;  	Non-Food Items (NFIs) and emergency shelter: Procurement and provision of core pipelines (Non-Food Items (NFIs) and shelter materials that are considered indispensable for the delivery of the frontline response;   	Common Services: increased logistic support to humanitarian partners through coordinating transshipment services and delivery of humanitarian cargo from Turkey into northwest Syria via the Bab Al-Hawa and Bab Al-Salam border crossings;   	Nutrition: scale-up of nutrition services to respond to increased needs where acute malnutrition of children 6-59 months has almost double one out of each three mothers and children in NWS is acutely malnourished and /or potentially anemic.

2020 1st Standard Allocation,"While displacement becomes more protracted, needs with longer-term impacts are increasing in prominence; this standard allocation aims to address both these sets of needs through immediate and slightly longer-term interventions to respond to high vulnerability level of a large part of the population living in northwest Syria. In doing so, it will also focus on strengthening elements of the preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as to adapt the response modalities to ensure the continuation and expansion of the humanitarian response.  The allocation will focus on the continuity of essential life-saving services and efforts to ensure dignified living conditions for the most vulnerable people in northwest Syria in both place of displacement, and in places of origin in cases where people have returned. Interventions will be prioritized based on the most recent needs assessments while ensuring the integration of doing no harm principles to mitigate vulnerabilities and build some element of sustainability into certain services such as WASH and Education. This allocation is also forward-thinking with the inclusion of winterization plans. These will start in August, given the lead times on the administrative and procurement processes.   The latest HNAP assessment conducted in March 2020 reported the priority needs are shelter (63%), basic services (59%) and food (55%). Accordingly, this allocation will align its response to meet these needs and ensure the continuation of basic services prioritizing most vulnerable people and have a strong emphasis on women and girls, people with disabilities and older persons and protection.  The allocation supports integration across all the clusters to better address needs and provide a comprehensive response. It strives to enhance coordination and collaboration between clusters and partners, and aspires to be more than just the simple inclusion of multiple cluster elements within a project, but rather support an integrated approach that combines mutually supportive programme elements, either within a single cluster or a multi-cluster, to achieve a common result. For example, for the establishment of new camps, WASH, CCM and S/NFI clusters will coordinate form very early planning stages to ensure that comprehensive services are provided.   Information on the humanitarian situation in northwest Syria is difficult to obtain, and access to affected communities remains the main challenge. The frequency and quality of current information flow are not consistent, while there are many sources of information are only accessible from the ground. This allocation will also support relevant common service that supports the wider humanitarian community.  In this context of increased uncertainty caused by several factors, the allocation will prioritize interventions factoring inflexible and responsible programming to rapidly adapt to changes to continue the provision of adequate basic services. The OCHA Humanitarian Financing team will continue working closely with partners to reprogramme should the need arise. Prioritized projects will propose a suitable risk management plan with a clear identification of internal and external risks and mitigation measures.  Interventions will be implemented according to cluster guidance and international humanitarian standards. New working modalities that include remote services and adjusted activities due to COVID-19 are supported and encouraged.

2020 2nd Standard Allocation,"This standard allocation aims to address two specific objectives: critical and life-saving gaps in the response to COVID-19 and the most urgent winterization needs of people, prioritizing underserved and high-needs areas. Considering the large amount of funding allocated by the SCHF during 2020 (US$166 million) and the limited funding available under this allocation, priority will be given to projects with strong emphasis on critical life-saving interventions that directly link with the allocation objectives. This allocation will call for strong integration and complementarity to ensure an efficient coverage of and response to emergency needs. These strategic objectives aim to provide timely seasonal assistance and support the continuity of essential life-saving interventions for vulnerable people in northwest Syria affected by displacement and in places of origin in cases where people have returned. Considering the approaching winter season and COVID-19 pandemic, projects with an ability to start implementation immediately will be prioritized, conditional on having a strong risk management in place and a robust strategy to ensure accountability to the affected population throughout the project cycle. Winterization assistance funded under this allocation will take a people-centred approach including ensuring community and individuals are wholly addressed. The prioritized list of activities has been listed in the section below. COVID-19 sensitive programming should be applied across the projects implemented under the different sectors and should become a part of regular programming. During the allocation process, final decisions on RCCE-related interventions will also include a review and evaluation from a representative of the relevant clusters. Interventions will be implemented according to cluster guidance and international humanitarian standards. New working modalities that include remote services and adjusted activities due to COVID-19 are supported and encouraged. Geographical locations prioritized under this allocation are in line with the most recent needs assessments, critical gaps and overburdened communities' analysis and clusters’ inputs. The allocation decision-making process will review locations prioritized in each and across clusters to ensure complementarity and avoid duplications, including with previous SCHF allocations. Interventions targeting high-needs and underserved areas in complementarity with other activities on the ground will be prioritized. The maximum duration possible is 12 months for projects funded under this allocation. Projects contributing to winterization should start as soon as possible and demonstrate a feasible and realistic implementation plan. Winterization projects should start distribution as soon as possible upon budget clearance to ensure a timely delivery of aid. Project funded under this allocation must demonstrate strong cost-efficiency, taking into consideration currency fluctuation, market prices and, where applicable, other ongoing projects funded by SCHF including already funded support costs. The budgets submitted must demonstrate coherence and relevance of the logical framework, proposed activities, and value for money.

2020 3rd Reserve Allocation,"The Allocation aims to rehabilitate and strengthen the physical access to ensure that the IDPs and host communities' in Northwest Syria, such as in Afrin and Azaz, continue to receive an uninterrupted supply of humanitarian assistance transported through Bab-Al Hawa (BAH) crossing point. The project also addresses the risks identified by the Logistics and Early Recovery clusters of further deterioration of already poor-conditions roads that are/will be used for the shipment of humanitarian supplies by clusters' partners, given that these roads will share the load of additional humanitarian traffic that used to go through Bab Al Salama (BAS) border crossing.     In view of the urgency, before winter arrives, the project has prioritized the rehabilitation of Al Ghazawiya to Afrin's northern entrance through eastern bypass section for immediate rehabilitation at various points whose specific rehabilitation needs have been identified in consultation with ERL, Log clusters and the two implementing partners on the ground. At these points, the road is in extremely poor conditions- containing many pits, being not paved, and lacking flood drainage systems. The total length of the rehabilitated road will be 20 km, and it will include the following work:  a. Rehabilitation, upgrade, and new construction of flood drainage systems such as culverts, channels, manholes, pipelines, storm-drain, etc.  b. Rehabilitation and upgrade of the current roads, including removal of the Asphalt layer, repair the sub-base and base layers, and re-asphalting works.  c. Road marking, traffic signage, road crash guard barriers, and street lighting in the most critical and crowded locations such as road intersections, curves, slopes,  d. Paving works (curbstone and interlocking tiles).  At the same time, considering the already dire situation affecting IDPs and host community members living in northwest Syria has been further exacerbated by the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak and economic fragility, the project will also collaterally contribute to provide livelihood opportunities to address protection needs stemming from severe economic vulnerability.     Under the overall management responsibility of UNDP, the project will be carried out over a period of four months (Sep-Dec 2020) by two ERL Partners, Bonyan Organization and Imaar Organization, with proven highly-technical record in the rehabilitation and reparation of roads and drainage systems, as well as in the creation of livelihood opportunities. The estimated cost is USD 1.5 million.    The rehabilitation of key sections of this route will therefore ensure that humanitarian aid continues to reach areas previously served via BAS and maintain an uninterrupted supply chain of life-saving items to those areas. It will directly benefit 645,963 individuals in need of assistance in Aleppo (316,524 women and girls and 329,439 men and boys) -this figure corresponds to the number of PiN in the subdistricts served previously by BAS as reported in HNO 2019.

2023 4th Reserve Allocation,"Between 5 and 18 October 2023, approximately 123,000 individuals from 91 communities have been displaced following a significant escalation of hostilities that impacted more than 1,400 locations across southern Idleb and western Aleppo, with shelling and airstrikes that continuing almost daily, representing the most significant escalation in the area since 2019. In summary, the displacement situation in Idleb and western Aleppo remains fluid, with a significant number of IDPs still living in displacement sites or with host communities. While some returns have been observed, the majority of IDPs remain displaced. The main pull factors for returns are security and family ties. In consideration of the resource deployed and programmed, following data collection and analysis and coordination with the clusters, SCHF proposed to launch a focused Reserve Allocation (RA4, 2023) to support additional and urgent needs, that cannot be covered by the current grants or standard Allocation to support “additional or medium-term needs” intended in this context, related to:     1.

2024 1st Standard Allocation,"The humanitarian crisis in northwest Syria has worsened due to ongoing conflict and economic hardship, exacerbating the needs of 4.2 million people (out of 5.02 million in total). With limited access to essential services and infrastructure, northwest Syria faces severe shortages in healthcare, education, protection, food security, water, sanitation, and shelter, among others.   Through the first Standard Allocation (SA1), the SCHF aims to provide a coordinated multi-sectoral humanitarian assistance to vulnerable internally displaced persons (IDPs) and other conflict-affected people in northwest Syria, with prioritized activities under the forthcoming 2024 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP). As funding gaps widen, with the HRP being 85 per cent underfunded, the ability of humanitarian partners to meet the critical needs of the most affected populations is hindered. This allocation aims to ensure continuity of the most critical services, being at risk of closure due to funding constraints. Priorities include access to basic health and education, community-led protection, infrastructure for flood mitigation, and life-saving food support. Key interventions involve emergency cash assistance, nutrition for children and mothers at risk of malnutrition, and WASH services in high-need areas. Increasing resilience by fostering social cohesion, access to dignified shelter solutions, food, and livelihoods support.   The SCHF’s will continue its commitment to foster meaningful local partnerships through promoting participation and capacity strengthening of Syrian organizations laying the foundation for long-term resilience and recovery in northwest Syria. The Standard allocation will be aiming to address the compounded needs of people with disabilities, vulnerable women, and children, especially in hard-to-reach areas, closest to the frontlines of conflict, areas with high concentration of IDPs, and other conflict-affected people in need of assistance.

2024 First Reserve Allocation,"The humanitarian response for northwest Syria remains alarmingly underfunded. As funding gaps widen for 2024, concerns about the ability of humanitarian partners to meet critical needs continue to grow. With less than two months left until the new year, the humanitarian response remains severely underfunded. As of 31 October, the 2024 Humanitarian Response Plan for Syria has received only over a quarter of the funding needed. Consequently, humanitarian activities and facilities have continued to be suspended in north-west Syria on a weekly basis.  At the same time, over 5 million people in northwest Syria are bracing for another cold winter season of unpredictable flooding, rainstorms and snow. Nearly 70 per cent of this population live in over 1,500 camps and informal settlements, often in overcrowded conditions and lacking basic amenities like sewage drainage, electricity, and water supply. After more than 13 years of conflict and displacement, 800,000 individuals, primarily women and children, are still living in tents. Last year, more than 1,000 shelters were damaged due to flooding, with 70 per cent of all displacement sites lacking basic care and maintenance.  The Deputy Regional Humanitarian Coordinator (DRHC) through the launch of SCHF first Reserve Allocation (RA1), aims to provide timely and flexible winter assistance while ensuring uninterrupted access to critical and lifesaving services to enhance the resilience of vulnerable individuals and groups, particularly internally displaced persons (IDPs) and other conflict-affected populations. The allocation priorities include access to basic health and education services, flexible emergency multipurpose cash assistance, and waste management to mitigate health hazards, while providing multisectoral assistance in accordance to the Winterization Plan to help families cope with freezing temperatures and hash weather.  The SCHF is committed to promoting localisation by prioritizing direct funding, participation, and capacity strengthening of Syrian organizations, laying the foundation for long-term resilience and recovery in northwest Syria. This allocation aims to address needs of people with disabilities, vulnerable women, and children, particularly in underserved, most in need and hard-to-reach areas close to conflict frontlines and in high concentrations of IDPs.

2025 First Standard Allocation,"The allocation released by the Syria Cross-border Humanitarian Fund (SCHF) and Syria Humanitarian Fund (SHF) represents a strategic, unified response to the acute and evolving humanitarian needs across Syria. In the aftermath of the government dissolution in 2024 and amid persistent conflict, seventy percent Syrians require urgent assistance, with displacement, returns, and continued instability reshaping the humanitarian landscape. While the current Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) targets eight million people and is only than 11 percent funded, this allocation ensures resources are directed where they are most impactful.  The strategy targets displaced populations, vulnerable host communities, and returnees in areas facing the most severe needs, while including contingency planning to enable rapid, principled response to new or escalating emergencies. By prioritizing multi-sectoral, integrated intervention, the allocation’s primary goal is to both save lives and stimulate resilience, supporting sustainable transitions for affected communities.  Aligned with the one Syria  vision, this allocation advances the consolidation of a renewed pooled fund and contributes to a unified, inclusive, and coordinated humanitarian response structure. By prioritizing streamlined collaboration, it enables more effective decision-making, with the full transition targeted for completion by 30 June 2025.

2022 Fourth Reserve Allocation (Winterization),"On 1 July 2022, humanitarian partners in Ukraine released the 2022-2023 Winterization Plan: Winter priority procurement and repair plan, which identified urgent winter procurement and repair activities targeting vulnerable IDPs and people living in sub-standard housing affected by the escalation of conflict since February. This Ukraine HF Reserve Allocation of up to $25 million will support the following time-critical, high-impact elements of the Winterization Plan:  insulation of sub-standard dwellings and damaged homes and provision of heating appliances and solid fuel in remote and rural areas of eastern and northern oblasts.  The reserve modality has been selected to allow for an expedited proposal vetting and review processes and rapid disbursement of funds to ensure the timely implementation of prioritized activities before the onset of the winter season. The tight sectoral and geographic focus complements ongoing and planned interventions by other donor and international agency initiatives addressing winterization needs and their concurrent programming under the Ukraine Flash Appeal.  This allocation will support the continued pursuit of UHF’s commitment on localization through promoting participation and capacity-strengthening of national and local partners, including small civil-society organizations with access to hard-to-reach locations and ability to deliver contextually relevant assistance. The allocation will also promote other cross-cutting priorities including gender and age considerations, disability inclusion, protection mainstreaming, and accountability in all partner programming.

UHF 2022 Second Reserve Allocation_Upscaling humanitarian aid,"The security situation across Ukraine, including in the two pre-existing conflict-affected Donetska and Luhanska oblasts (regions), deteriorated rapidly. The intense hostilities – both in the ‘traditional’ hotspots along the “contact line” and new areas throughout Ukraine, including in Kyiv, have resulted in the loss of life, injuries and mass movement of the civilian population throughout the country and to neighboring countries.     The ongoing military offensive and rapidly deteriorating security environment throughout the country has put hundreds of thousands of people’s lives at risk. The expansion of the insecurity to the areas previously unaffected by hostilities is projected to create new humanitarian needs among millions of Ukrainians. This allocation is adapting to the newly unfolding situation.    Therefore, the humanitarian coordinator will release US$18 Million from the UHF to: (1) Provide timely lifesaving multisectoral assistance to displaced and non-displaced persons, who are affected by the escalation of hostilities, (2) Protect conflict-affected people and civilian infrastructure regarding international humanitarian law, norms, and standards, (3) Support provision of basic services in areas impacted by the escalation of hostilities.",Reserve,4E+07,3/1/2022 12:00:00 AM,3/31/2022 12:00:00 AM,1.

UHF 2023 Second Reserve Allocation (Winterization),"In August 2023, the OCHA and the ICCG developed a winter response plan which prioritized activities in three sectors (WASH, Shelter NFI and FSL/Agriculture) under the 2023 Ukraine Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) to support the winter needs faced by vulnerable IDPs and people living in sub-standard housing affected by the escalation of conflict. This UHF Reserve Allocation of up to $55 million will support the following time-critical, high-impact activities of the winterization response identified in the plan.    The reserve modality has been selected to allow for an expedited proposal vetting and review processes and rapid disbursement of funds to ensure the timely implementation of prioritized activities before the onset of the winter season.

Second, to ensure the continuity of life saving service provision and improving dignified living conditions by targeting districts where the living conditions in IDP sites are below standard.
