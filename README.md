# OCHA Charts

This is the repository for the charts and data visualisations at the OCHA sites. 

All the charts and data visualisations in this repository are SVG elements created using [D3.js](https://d3js.org), a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. 

Instructions for the use of the charts and data visualisations can be found in their specific links.


## CSS

All charts and data visualisations in this repository use a [common CSS](https://github.com/CBPFGMS/cbpfgms.github.io/raw/master/css/) file.
