# PFBI: CBPF Contributions, lollipop chart

Data visualisation for the Country-based Pooled Funds (CBPF) contributions in the Business Inteligence Portal at [pfbi.unocha.org](https://pfbi.unocha.org). The datavis contains several elements:

- A set of buttons allowing the selection of the year and the contribution (paid, pledge or total);
- A top banner showing the contributions (paid, pledge and total), the number of donors and the number of CBPFs for the selected year and type of contribution;
- Two lollipop charts, one for the donors and one for the CBPFs, according to the selected year and contribution type.

Also, at the top right corner, there is a set of buttons:

- **Share**: copies a link with all the current selections to the clipboard. Use that link to go to the Bookmark page;
- **Image**: downloads a snapshot of the chart, as a .png file or as a .pdf file. You can also right-click anywhere in the chart to download a snapshot containing the tooltip;
- **Csv**: downloads the data as a .csv file;
- **Help**: shows an annotated layer with tips about how to use and how to understand the chart.

## Getting started

Copy this snippet to the HTML:

```<div id="d3chartcontainerpbiclc" data-title="CBPF Contributions" data-year="2018" data-contribution="total" data-selectedcountry="none" data-showhelp="false" data-showlink="true" data-responsive="true" data-lazyload="true"></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cbpfgms.github.io/pbiclc/src/d3chartpbiclc.js"></script>```

The script will create an SVG inside the `<div>` specified in the snippet. For better results, the snippet should be inside a container 900px wide.

The JavaScript code will also reference [D3.js](https://d3js.org) version 5, the [specific CSS](https://github.com/CBPFGMS/cbpfgms.github.io/raw/master/css/d3chartstylespbiclc.css) file and the [common CSS](https://github.com/CBPFGMS/cbpfgms.github.io/raw/master/css/d3chartstyles.css) file.

***Important***: The code uses `window.innerHeight` to start the animation when `"data-lazyload"` is set to `true`. If you copy this snippet inside an iframe or any other element that avoids the correct calculation of `window.innerHeight`, set `"data-lazyload"` to `false`.

## Parameters

There are eight parameters:

**`data-title`**: sets the title of the chart. If left empty the chart title defaults to *CBPF Contributions*.

**`data-year`**: defines the year depicted by the data visualisation when the page loads. The value has to be a string containing the year with century as a decimal number, such as:

 `"2018"`

If the provided value is not a valid number the datavis will default to the current year. For the accepted values for the years please refer to the data API.

Multiple years are allowed. In this case, the values have to be separated by comma, for instance:

`"2016, 2017, 2018"`

This value defines only the selected year when the page loads: the user can easily change the selected year by clicking the corresponding buttons. Also, the user can select more than one year.

**`data-contribution`**: defines the contribution type depicted by the data visualisation when the page loads. The value has to be a string. Accepted values:

- `"total"`: shows the total contributions (paid + pledge).
- `"paid"`: shows only the paid contributions.
- `"pledge"`: shows only the pledged values.

If the value is not an accepted value, it defaults to `"total"`.

**`data-selectedcountry`**: defines the selected country (donor or CBPF) when the page loads. For not selecting any country set the value to `"none"`, or just leave it empty:

`""`

For individual countries set the value accordingly, such as:

`"Yemen"`.

For more than one country separate the values with commas, such as:

`"Yemen, Sudan, Iraq"`.

In such cases, the list must contain only donors or only CBPFs.

If the selected country is both a donor and a CBPF, define which one will be selected by using `"@"` followed by `"donor"` or `"fund"`. For instance, `"Ukraine@donor"` will select Ukraine as a donor, while `"Ukraine@fund"` will select Ukraine as a fund. If the selected country is both a donor and a CBPF but there is no indication regarding which one should be selected (`"@fund"` or `"@donor"`), the value will default to `"none"`.

For the accepted values, please refer to the data API. If the value is not a valid one it defaults to `"none"`. This value defines only the selected country when the page loads: the CBPFs (and donors) can be easily selected by clicking on the lollipops.

**`data-showhelp`**: shows the annotations explaining how to use the data visualisation. Accepted values:

- `"true"`: annotations shown when the page loads.
- `"false"`: annotations not shown when the page loads. The user can easily show the annotations by clicking the "help" button.

If the value is neither `"true" ` nor `"false"`, it defaults to `"false" `.

**`data-showlink`**: shows the *"for more information"* link in the footer. Accepted values:

- `"true"`: shows the link.
- `"false"`: doesn't show the link.

If the value is neither `"true" ` nor `"false"`, it defaults to `"false" `.

**`data-responsive`**: defines if the SVG stretches to the width of the containing element. Accepted values:

- `"true"`: the SVG will stretch to the width of the element containing the code snippet.
- `"false"`: the SVG will be created with a fixed size, which is 900px width (the height of the SVG varies according to the number of donors/CBPFs in the selected year).

**`data-lazyload`**: defines if the animation starts when the SVG is visible. Accepted values:

- `"true"`: the animation starts only when the SVG is visible in the browser window.
- `"false"`: the animation starts when the page is loaded, regardless if the SVG is visible.

If the value is neither `"true" ` nor `"false"`, it defaults to `"false" `.

*Recommended size*: 900px (width).
